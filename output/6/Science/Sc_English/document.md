## FOREWORD

The National Education Policy 2020, envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pafichakoshas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grades 6 to 8.

This framework, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made

all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, is one of these. It has been developed in consonance with the recommendations of NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023 to take students on a journey of experiential learning by citing examples from the world of the learners. The content stimulates curiosity, a sense of exploration, questioning, and critical thinking. The content seamlessly weaves together concepts from physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, along with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The textbook aims to engage learners through an integrated approach by including multiple activities and thoughtful use of technology. The textbook offers ample opportunities for reflection and group discussions.

To encourage creativity and innovation, it is feasible to regard students as active participants in the learning process, rather than mere recipients of a predetermined set of knowledge. This can only be achieved if the necessary number of hours are dedicated to science teaching-learning annually as outlined in NCF-SE 2023. The pedagogical approach of the textbook also considers how important it is for students to think critically, reason well and make decisions. It also provides students with numerous opportunities to learn from each other, making the learning experience more engaging for both teachers and students.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

## ABOUT THE BOOK

Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6 learners has been crafted in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The policy advocates a radical shift from a content-based education to a competency-based education, particularly in the realm of science. Therefore, the formulation of curricular goals for Science, subsequent competencies and learning outcomes are tailored towards competency-based learning. These curricular goals encompass various scientific concepts, including matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the exploration of the interface between science, society and technology. Additionally, the goals focus on the nature of science, its processes, historical and contemporary aspects of the development of science and science communication. While these goals are explicitly articulated, they are interdependent and collectively contribute to a better understanding of the world around us. Accordingly, the chapters of this textbook are structured around creative activities, reflective questions, processes and illustrations. The integration of the concepts from biology, chemistry, physics and earth science, and cross-cutting themes, such as value education, inclusive education, Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) and environmental education have been interwoven in the content. Thus, the textbook aims to provide experience-based learning, rather than simply reading and memorising the concepts.

In the Middle Stage, science teaching-learning adopts an integrated approach. This integrated approach develops fundamental capacities across biology, chemistry, physics and earth science. The use of an integrated approach helps the learners to appreciate the interrelations between subjects and make sense of their observations and experiences.

Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, comprises twelve chapters. As the name of the textbook suggests, there are numerous opportunities for the learners to explore the world of science and its nature. Through the chapters, learners will embark on a journey that will connect them to the world around and spark curiosity for further exploration. The hands-on activities embedded within each chapter engages the learners and provide them an opportunity to


## Reprint 2025-26

23/12/2024 16:06:55

reflect on learning. These activities are inclusive in nature. Some activities require both the teacher and learners to prepare in advance.

Chapter 1, titled ‘The Wonderful World of Science’, provides a holistic view of the new topic of Science introduced in the Middle Stage. It showcases, through examples, the essence of Science—a way of thinking, observing, and finding out by doing, and by asking questions. This chapter weaves together the concepts covered in the rest of the book, and aims to excite the readers as they start their adventures into the world of science. There are no assessment exercises in this chapter and is designed to be non-evaluative. Also, every chapter in the book begins with an introduction that makes the learners curious and tries to show different ways with which the goals of the curriculum can be achieved effectively. The chapters begin with the stories related to real-life situations, these are meant to capture learners’ interest and connect them with what is already known. The various activities given are based on scientific processes, designed to provide hands and minds-on experiences. Following each activity, there are questions to help learners understand and assess how well they have grasped the information. Questions are significant in the learning process. They help learners to explore and reinforce their understanding. One will also find many thought-provoking questions designed to encourage deep thinking, self-awareness and critical analysis. These questions prompt learners to ponder and delve deeper into their thoughts.

In order to sustain the interest of the readers, some of the challenging ideas, additional information, poems, stories, strange facts and other interesting materials are also presented as add on non-evaluative content in the boxes labelled ‘Do you know?’, ‘More to know!’, ‘Think it over!’ and ‘More to do!’. The thrill of scientific inquiry comes from pursuing the unknown, giving learners the opportunity to think and explore beyond the syllabus. Some chapters also include a section called ‘Know a scientist’, which presents the contributions ofIndianscientists related to that concept. Allthese box items, including brief biographies of scientists, are non-evaluative. The important ideas and steps in understanding a given concept of science are included as ‘Keywords’ at the end of each chapter. These ‘Keywords’ will help learners to acknowledge various

23/12/2024 16:06:56


## 0 Prelims.indd 7

ideas and encourage them to think more deeply about the content. The keywords related to scientific processes depict the steps or procedure involved in the scientific activities. These words guide learners on how scientific knowledge is generated, tested and applied. ‘Summary’ offers an overview of the chapter’s main points, reinforcing the key ideas discussed. It serves to outline the content presented in the chapter. A non-evaluative interesting element that has been incorporated in some of the chapters is the introduction of certain verses from various Indian texts to promote rootedness in the learners as envisaged in NEP 2020.

The primary aim of Curiosity is to prepare the children for becoming the responsible members of the society, and therefore efforts have been made to raise awareness about various issues, such as gender, region, environment, health and hygiene, water scarcity and energy conservation. Activities given in the book endeavour to promote peer-learning and group activities.

The assessment exercises, ‘Let us enhance our learning’, play a vital role in the learning process. They help to reinforce the understanding and identify areas for improvement, making them essential components of effective teaching and learning. Assessment consists of various exercises, from pictorial questions to creating puzzles and multiple-choice questions, to create a challenging and interesting experience for the learners. These questions also facilitate the evaluation of various competencies expected to be developed through a particular chapter. Peer and group activities to explore answers to the questions are also encouraged.

A significant feature of the book is what we termed as ‘Learning further’. In this section, some projects and activities are designed to increase learners’ interaction with experts, teachers, parents and the wider community. Learners are encouraged to gather diverse information and draw their own conclusions.

The textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should enhance their knowledge by exploring and observing their surroundings. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can also be a valuable tool for learners’ learning and development, when used appropriately. Learners can explore ICT with the help of Quick Response (QR) codes provided in the textbook. QR codes make the reading experiences more interactive and enjoyable. These QR


## vii

codes that have additional resources can be accessed by the learners at their own convenience and pace. These additional resources include videos, puzzles, games, quizzes, audio, documentaries and additional content on some topics.

At the end of this book, learners will find a page titled ‘It is not the end, my friend!’. This includes words of encouragement, motivating learners to continue their educational journey and ignite their curiosity for further learning. It is meant to be non-evaluative.

May the journey of every learner be filled with joy and continue the curiosity in the higher grades as well!

We express our gratitude to all the members of the textbook development committee for their contributions in shaping this textbook. We look forward to the feedback of the readers.

Along with food, we need water to survive. Water is sucha delightful substance. Have you ever jumped in a puddle when it rained? Do you ever wonder why and how it rains?

Have you noticed that water freezes and becomes ice when we cool it and boils and becomes steam when we heat it? Do you enjoy drinking cool water in the summer or showering with warm water in the winter? How do we understand hot and cold? Whether it is water, or our own body when we have fever, finding out how hot something is can be important!

Then again, there are so many different things around us—the paper we write on, the metal key, the plastic ruler and the rubber eraser in our box, the magnet that keeps the box closed, the clothes we wear, the cup we drink milk in and so many other things. What are they made of? Are they made of different materials? How do we separate different materials from one another?

We will have an almost unending list of questions about everything on Earth as we further explore this book. But why limit our questions to the Earth alone? We can ask questions on things beyond—the Sun, the Moon, and the millions of stars that shine in the sky!

Whether you are learning about the structure of a leaf, discovering how things move, or separating the skin of a peanut seed, we hope each chapter of this book will ignite your spirit of inquiry. And hopefully you will have lots of questions on your mind!

Even though you may have not realised, you have already been finding answers to many of your questions. Suppose your pen stops writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself the question, “Why did my pen stop writing?” You might guess that the ink finished.

You would then test this guess by opening the pen and checking the ink refill. If it is empty, you would know that your guess was correct. But suppose you found that the ink was not finished. Now what would you do? You would make another guess—perhaps the ink might have dried up. To test if this guess is correct or not, you will try something else.

This is exactly how Science works! The way you tried to find out why your pen stopped writing is an example of the scientific method.

How can we try

to find answers toour questions @ on our own?

Scientists are people who follow the scientific method to solve problems or to discover new things. But anyone who follows the scientific method is working like a scientist. Someone cooking food may be wondering why the dal has spilled out of the cooker—was there too much water?

Think of a bicycle repair person trying to find out why a tyre is flat—from where did the air leak out? Or an electrician trying to find why a light bulb is not working—is there some problem with the bulb or the switch? When we try to ask questions and find out answers, we are all, in a way, scientists!

method? Though we all apply the scientific method to some extent, learning science will develop our capabilities for finding solutions to bigger problems and solving more mysteries of the universe. And to be able to learn science well, the first and foremost thing is to be curious and observe your surroundings keenly. And when we are curious, we start posing questions, asking how and why? Just remember, the world is full of things we do not know, things that are waiting to be explored.

Activity 1.3: Let us think and write SE

@ Ifyou have to ask “Why?” about something, what would you ask about?

Science is rarely done alone. Scientists across the world work together, often in large teams. So, if you cannot find an answer yourself, ask your friends to help you out! It is always more fun to discover things together.

Of course, remember that you will not find answers to all your questions in Grade 6. Do not worry, you are embarking upon a journey of science for the next five years or even beyond!

facilitate an exciting nature walk. Dr Raghu is a scientist at the nearby Research Laboratory and Maniram chacha is an elderly person from a nearby community. Maniram chacha is an expert in mimicking bird calls. He is also brilliant at identifying a variety of plants and animals.

To prepare them for the nature walk, Dr Raghu informs the students that the objective of this walk is to experience the beauty and variety of plants and animals in the nature. The students are excited to join them. They are curious to interact and learn from them. The teacher advises the students to carry a notebook, a pen and a water bottle.

As they walk, they begin exploring the plants and animals around them. Dr Raghu advises the students to notice the variety of smells in the park and emphasises respecting all living creatures and observing them without disturbing. Maniram chacha tells the students to not only observe different plants and animals but also to carefully listen to different sounds. The students come across a variety of plants, including grasses, bushes, and large trees. They also observe a variety of birds sitting on the branches of trees, butterflies moving from flower to flower and monkeys jumping from one tree to another. They record their observations in their notebooks and discuss them with Dr Raghu and Maniram chacha.

The students can hear the chirping of birds. Dr Raghu informs them that each bird has a unique chirp. This is an example of diversity in nature. Dr Raghu requests Maniram ,,, chacha to mimic calls of some birds. Maniram chacha mimics different bird calls. The students enthusiastically start copying him.

You must have noticed that plants show variation in the features related to stems, leaves, flowers, and more. The stems of different plants vary in thickness, height, and hardness, while the leaves vary in shape, colour, size and arrangement. You might have tried grouping the plants in Activity 2.3 using one of these features.

You might have also learnt in earlier classes that plants can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their height and types of stem. Let us study the features of plants in more detail and group them on that basis.

Some plants are typically small with soft and green stems. These are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a herb (Fig. 2.3c).

Some plants with weak stems need support to climb and grow, and are called climbers. Some plants creep along the ground and are called creepers.

¢ Look at the leaves of different plants collected by you, during the nature walk.

¢ Do you notice any variation in the shape and structure of these leaves?

You may observe thin lines on the leaves of the plants (Fig. 2.4a). These are veins. The pattern of veins on the leaf is called venation. What differences do you see in the veins of leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b?

In some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of veins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is called reticulate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus exhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you may observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called parallel venation. For example, the leaves of banana plants and grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c).

Another example of a plant having taproots is hibiscus observed by you in Activity 2.1. The plant in Fig. 2.5b is a common grass plant. The roots of this plant appear as a bunch of similar-sized thin roots arising from the base of the stem. Such roots are called fibrous roots (Fig. 2.5b).

Do other plants with reticulate venation have taproots too? Lemongrass, on the other hand, has fibrous roots and its leaves have parallel venation. Do other plants with parallel venation have fibrous roots too? Generally, plants with reticulate venation have taproots while those with parallel venation have fibrous roots.

Chickpea (chana) is another example of a plant with taproots and reticulate venation in leaves. Wheat is an example of a plant with fibrous roots and parallel venation in its leaves.

You would notice that chickpea seeds are split into two parts (Fig. 2.6a). Each part is called a cotyledon. Plants that have seeds with two cotyledons are called dicotyledons (dicots). Maize has a single thin cotyledon (Fig. 2.6b). Plants with such seeds are called monocotyledons (monocots).

What relation do you observe among leaf venation, root types and the number of cotyledons in seeds of a plant? Dicot plants have reticulate venation and a taproot system while monocot plants have parallel venation and a fibrous root system.

What conclusions can you draw from the data given in Table 2.5?

Different animals have different types of movement. Animals can fly, run, crawl, walk, hop or jump, and so on. They use different body parts for moving from one place to another. They may use wings, legs, and other parts that help them to move. Here, we have identified animals based on the types of movement and the body parts used for movement. How can we group animals based on their movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each other in shape, size, structure, colour, and other features. Some of these features can also be used to group animals in various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important for understanding their diversity.

Janaki Ammal (1897-1984) was an Indian botanist dedicated to environmental work and helped to document and preserve India’s rich plant biodiversity. She played a key role in the ‘Save Silent Valley’ movement. As the head of the Botanical Survey of India, she initiated programmes to document the plant diversity of India.

Does the movement of these animals depend upon their surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. Fishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes and shapes of animals also differ from one another.

During a discussion in the classroom, Alex recalls that he observed cactus plants with thick and fleshy stems in the deserts of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.9). Maya shares that she saw deodar trees in the Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh (Fig. 2.10). These trees are conical in shape and have flexible and sloping branches.

Notice that these two types of plants Fig. 2.10: A deodar found in different regions are different tree in the mountains

from each other. Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of a region vary from that of another? Let us find out.

There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places.

The mountains in extremely cold regions experience frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees enable them to do so easily.

You must have understood by now that the biodiversity varies from region to region because of diverse conditions.

Look at the images of a camel from the hot desert of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe between them? What advantages do these differences provide to these camels?

Hooves Hooves Fig. 2.11: A camel living in the hot Fig. 2.12: A camel living in the desert of Rajasthan cold desert of Ladakh

The camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. Alex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs and wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the height and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.

In deserts, food is not available easily. Camels store food in their humps. Camels found in the hot desert have one hump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of food. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not much food available in the cold desert and they have to use food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive the cold winters of Ladakh.

What other features can help camels to survive in the desert?

Other students also start sharing their observations. Kashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small amounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. As camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they can survive for many days without drinking water.

Maya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright flowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. Here, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller leaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain tops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she has observed rhododendrons in the nearby mountains to be taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons may exhibit different features in different regions to survive the conditions of those regions.

We have learnt that the plants and animals living in a particular region have special features that make them fit to survive there. The special features that enable plants and animals to survive in a particular region are called adaptations.

The shape of the deodar tree and the height of the rhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive in the mountainous regions.

The place where plants and animals live is called their habitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, water, air, shelter and other needs for their survival. Many types of plants and animals may share the same habitat. Habitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity of a region.

Salim Ali (1896-1987) travelled across India to observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list of birds and documented their travel routes and habitats. He recorded the regions with high diversity of birds and took measures to conserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of regions he preserved. He wrote a landmark series of 10 books on birds of the Indian Subcontinent. He is referred to as the ‘Birdman of India’. He was awarded Padma Vibhushan in 1976.

What are the different ways in which you can group plants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to group them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live in water’.

The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains.

The plants and animals that live in water are said to live in aquatic habitats. Some examples of aquatic habitats are ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans.

Some animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as on land. These are called amphibians.

What would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal is damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass to eat? Can a fish survive without water?

Check with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours to know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see as often now. These changes often happen when habitats are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals results in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. This leads to the loss of biodiversity.

The population of the Bengal Tiger, Cheetah, and Great Indian Bustard has declined in India due to loss of natural habitats caused by human activities. The Government of India has initiated several projects to conserve our biodiversity. ‘Project Tiger’ was initiated in 1973 to protect the declining population of the Bengal Tiger. The ‘Cheetah Reintroduction Project’ was initiated in 2022 to restore the population of the Cheetah. Similarly, habitats of the Great Indian Bustards have been declared as Protected areas in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.

¢ Plants and animals can be grouped on the basis of similarities and differences among them.

¢ Plants have similarities and differences based on features associated with roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and so on.

¢ The method of arranging things into groups based on their common features is called grouping.

¢ Plants can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their heights, types of stem, and branching patterns.

¢ Plants can also be grouped as dicotyledons (dicots) and monocotyledons (monocots) based on the number of cotyledons in their seeds.

¢ Monocots generally exhibit parallel venation in their leaves and possess fibrous roots while dicots typically exhibit reticulate venation in their leaves and possess taproots.

¢ Animals have different types of movement that can be a basis for their grouping.


## ¢ Biodiversity of different regions varies because of distinct environmental conditions.

The special features that enable plants and animals to survive in a particular region are called adaptations.

¢ The place where plants and animals live is their habitat.

There is a significant difference between traditional and modern culinary practices. Earlier, most cooking was done using a chulha (Fig. 3.1a). Nowadays, most of us cook using a modern gas stove (Fig. 3.1b). Earlier, most grinding was done manually using a sil-batta (Fig. 3.1c). These days, we use an electrical grinder for ease of grinding (Fig. 3.1d). Find out what were the other ways of cooking and grinding. Why have these culinary practices changed over time?

Why do you think we are advised to include servings of fruits, vegetables and other plant-based foods in our daily diet? Let us understand the importance of some other food components by reading the following two cases—


## Case 1

In earlier times, during long voyages, sailors often suffered from bleeding and swollen gums. During a voyage in 1746, Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a disease called scurvy.

What do you interpret by reading Case 1? What cures scurvy? Lemons and oranges help in curing scurvy. Scurvy is caused due to deficiency of Vitamin C. Vitamin C present in citrus fruits like lemons and oranges helps in curing this disease.


## Case 2

In the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the human population in the Himalayan region and the Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling at the front of the neck were prevalent. As per norms of the Government of India, an effort was made to supplement common salt with iodine for preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised salt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling at the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre.


## Reprint 2025-26

10/4/2024 3:19:26 PM

What do you infer from Case 2?

You may have learnt about iodised salt through newspapers, advertisements or by reading about it on a salt packet. What does it mean? Iodised salt is simply common salt mixed with required quantities of salts of iodine.

What differences do you observe in raw and cooked vegetables? Have you ever noticed that vegetables sometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and less crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and others are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it not be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into our diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may also result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is highly recommended that all fruits and vegetables be thoroughly washed before consumption.

Fruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see how dietary fibres are beneficial for us.

In addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary fibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do not provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools.

Coluthur Gopalan (1918-2019) initiated nutrition research in India. He analysed more than 500 Indian foods for their nutritional value and recommended an appropriate diet in the Indian context. He led surveys on the nutritional status of the Indian population, identifying widespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food components. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day Meal Programme in 2002, now a ‘PM POSHAN’ initiative, to provide balanced food in the government-run and government-aided schools of our country. This scheme has played a role in improving the health and nutrition of millions of children nationwide.

Are nutritional requirements the same for everyone? Do you and your grandparents need the same type or the same amount of nutrients? Requirements of the type and amount of nutrients in a diet may vary according to age, gender, physical activity, health status, lifestyle, and so on.


## Activity 3.8: Let Us firvcl Ut ~~ mmm

You have listed food consumed by you during the week in Activity 3.1. Check whether your food contains all the nutrients and other essential components necessary for growth and development. If not, check which nutrients or other food components need to be added.

A diet that has all essential nutrients, roughage, and water in the right amount for proper growth and development of the body is known as a balanced diet. What changes would you make in your diet to make it a balanced diet?

Some foods have high calories due to high sugar and fat content. Moreover, they contain very low amounts of proteins, minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibres. These foods are called junk foods. These foods include potato wafers, candy bars and carbonated drinks. Consuming these foods frequently is not good as these are not healthy for our body. They make a person obese. Such a person may suffer from several health problems. You should always remember Dr Poshita’s statement that ‘Health is the Ultimate Wealth.’ We should take care of our body to stay healthy.

Culinary practices have changed over time. There is a significant difference between traditional and modern methods of cooking food.

Food provides us energy, support growth, repairs our bodies and protects us from diseases.

The major nutrients in our food are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. In addition, food also contains dietary fibres and water.

Carbohydrates and fats are primary energy sources, while proteins are body-building nutrients.

Vitamins and minerals strengthen our body, protect us from infections, and keep us healthy.

A balanced diet provides all the essential nutrients in the right quantities, along with adequate roughage and water.

Deficiency of one or more nutrients in our diet for a long time can lead to deficiency diseases and disorders.

Junk foods are unhealthy as they contain high levels of sugar and fats but little protein, minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibres.

Millets are known as nutri-cereals as they provide most of the nutrients required for the normal functioning of our bodies. They can be easily cultivated in different climatic conditions.

Eating food that is locally grown and plant-based, to the extent possible, is not only healthy for our bodies but is also good for our environment and our planet.

The distance travelled by a food item, from the place of its production to the consumer, is called food miles. We must aim to minimise food miles.

We should never waste food and only take as much as we can consume.

Reshma lives in a coastal town of Kerala and is very fond of writing short stories. Her grandmother loves listening to her stories, so Reshma was writing a new story to share with her grandmother on her 60th birthday.

The story was based ona ship carrying spices from Kerala for trade in the olden days. Reshma was aware that in those days, * the sailors used stars to find © directions at night. But in her story, a situation arose wherein the sailors got caught in a storm with an overcast sky and stars were not visible. Reshma could not take her story forward as she could not think of a way for sailors to find directions.

She searched for information on the internet and her school library. She learnt that the travellers used a device,

known as a magnetic compass, for finding directions.

Reshma had seen pencil boxes and

purses which had magnets to keep them

closed. A writing board in her school

also had a duster with a magnet. But she had never looked at those carefully. She now became curious to learn more about magnets and magnetic compasses.

The magnets used by sailors in the olden days were based on naturally occurring magnets, known as lodestones which were discovered in ancient times. Later on, people found out that magnets could also be made from pieces of iron. Nowadays, we have magnets made of different materials. The magnets that you find in your school laboratory and those used in pencil boxes, stickers, toys are all artificial magnets (Fig. 4.1). The magnets can be of various shapes, some of which are shown in Fig. 4.2.

More to know!

A freely suspended magnet comes to rest along the north-south direction. The end of the magnet that points towards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or the North pole of the magnet. The other end that points towards the South direction is called the South-seeking pole or the South pole of the magnet. A freely suspended magnet rests along the north-south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet.

Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of the bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along any direction. This implies that only magnets rest along north-south direction. This activity provides us with a way to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not.

The property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest along the north-south direction is used to find directions. Based on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was developed in olden days for finding directions. It has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can rotate freely (Fig. 4.6). The needle of a magnetic compass indicates the north-south direction.

The compass is kept at the place where we wish to know the directions. After some time, the needle comes to rest in the north-south direction. The compass box is then gently rotated until the

north and south marked on the dial are aligned with the needle. Now all directions at that place

Hardeep says, “I have seen my grandmother measuring cloth by the length of her arm.”

“Have you ever seen how a farmer measures length to divide his field into beds? He walks and counts the number of his strides,” says Padma.

“Oh, not just the length of the strides—sometimes they also use the length of their feet to measure,” adds Anish.

Deepa says excitedly, “Measuring length using body parts must be so much fun! Let us also measure something using a body part.”

“What should we measure? Okay, let us measure the length ofthe table in our classroom,” says Tasneem.

Padma adds, “And which body part should we use to measure it?”

Deepa says, “Let us use our handspan. I will show you how to use it. I have seen my mother using it. She calls it balisht.”

Hardeep adds, “Okay. Let us also note down

Padma says, “Oh, the number of handspans is different for all of us. So, what can we say about the length of the table?”

“But why should the number be different?” Hardeep asked thoughtfully.

Tasneem says, “I can guess. Our handspans are of different sizes.”

Anish gives an idea, “Let us check this.”

So, all five of them put their handspans along each other and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their handspans are different.

Deepa says thoughtfully, “No wonder people use scales and measuring tapes.”

Deepa and her friends compare the length of the table with the length of their handspans. The length of the table is expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan used for measurement is an example ofa unit. And the length is expressed in two parts, anumber and a unit. For example, if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then 13 is the number and ‘handspan’ is the unit selected for the measurement.

However, handspans and other similar units, such as length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which measurements of the same length made by different people do not differ.

## Chapter 5.indd 82

Several systems of units evolved with time in different parts of the world. However, when people started travelling from one place to another, it created a lot of confusion. This led to the different countries coming together and adopting a set of standard units of measurement. The system of units now used is known as the ‘International System of Units’ or SI units.

The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol is m. A metre scale is shown in Fig. 5.2. One metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You may be familiar with a smaller part of the metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in Fig. 5.3.

Look carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has markings (in cm) from 0 to 15. The length of any section between two consecutive big marks, such as between 1 and 2 or between 5 and 6, is 1 cm. Observe that these sections

For measuring larger lengths, we use a larger unit called a kilometre (km) which is equal to 1000 metres. And for measuring smaller lengths, we use units such as centimetre or millimetre.

## Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6


## Chapter 5.indd 84

For measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale. For example, if you want to measure the length of your pencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of a room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a measuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor’s tape is more suitable.

While measuring lengths, we need to take care of some points.

What is the correct way to place the scale?

Place the scale in contact with the object along its length as shown in Fig. 5.4.


## (a) Correct (b) Incorrect

Fig. 5.4: Method of placing the scale

What is the correct position of the eye while reading the scale?

For example, if you are trying to measure the length of a pencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye should be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5).

How to measure the length if the ends of the scale are broken?

If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is 10.4 cm-1.0 cm = 9.4 cm.

We have learnt that =e A rN materials may be classified on (of the basis of their properties.

For example, in the A A\, cof) al kitchen, we usually store things in such a manner Fig. 6.4: Grouping of objects where similar utensils are placed together. Similarly, a grocer usually keeps all types of spices in one corner, pulses and grains in another corner and so on. You may also visit any chemist shop and enquire about how medicines are arranged.


## 6.3 What are the Different Properties of Materials?

Let us learn some more properties of materials.

6.3.1 Observe and identify appearance of materials

Materials often look different from each other. Freshly cut wood, which is unpolished, has a distinct appearance, quite different from that of iron. Similarly, iron looks different from copper or aluminium. However, there might be some similarities among iron, copper and aluminium that make them different from wood.

Let us doa sorting challenge! Collect small pieces of paper, cardboard, wood, chalk, copper wire, aluminium foil and any article made up of brass, bronze, steel, etc. Take a look at the pieces you have collected. Do any of these materials shine when light falls on them? Observe their texture (whether

rough or smooth), colour and other noticeable features, and record your observations in the notebook. Group the collected pieces based on their appearance.

Materials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to have a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous materials are those that do not have a shiny surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc.

“All that glitters is not gold” goes an old saying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. Surfaces of some materials are made shiny by polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, wax or any other material which makes them look shiny. These materials may not be metals.


## Are all lustrous

6.3.2 Which materials are hard?

When you press different objects or materials with your hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other material or object. Can some materials be scratched more easily than others? Materials which can be compressed or scratched easily are soft, while other materials which are difficult to compress or scratch are hard. However, these properties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is harder than sponge but softer than iron.

Ghulan, Sheeta and Sara are playing hide and seek with their friends. Ghulan hides behind a wall, Sheeta hides behind a big tree in the garden while Sara hides behind the frosted glass door (which has a hazy surface). Sheeta’s younger brother can see all of this happening through a glass window of his house.

The materials, through which things can be seen clearly, are called transparent. Glass, water, air, cellophane paper, etc., are some examples of transparent materials.

Why did Ghulan, Sheeta and Sara choose these places to hide?

Do you think it would be possible for Sheeta’s brother to see her and her friends through a closed wooden window of the house?

Ghulan was sweating when he came home after playing in the evening. He was feeling tired and thirsty. Ghulan’s mother mixed a spoonful of sugar, a pinch of salt and some lemon juice in a glass tumbler of water and offered him this shikanji (lemonade) to drink.

Ghulan noticed that while his mother was mixing sugar and salt in water, the salt and the sugar disappeared after a while.

ORS—Oral Rehydration Solution— is used to treat dehydration due to diarrhoea or other illnesses. These ready-made ORS packets are

available in primary health centres and also in the market. Each packet is dissolved in a litre of water before use. If these are not available, ORS can be prepared at home by mixing six teaspoons of sugar and half a teaspoon of common salt in one litre of boiled and cooled water.

Do liquids like oil, vinegar and honey dissolve in water? Explore.

What about the gases present in water?

Some liquids get completely mixed with water. Some do not mix with water and form a separate layer when left undisturbed for some time. Similarly, some gases are soluble in water whereas others are not. For example, oxygen gas dissolves in water. It is very important for the survival of animals and plants that live in water.

The one which is heavier has more mass and the one which is lighter has less mass.

Next day, Madam Vidya enters the class. All the students stand up to greet her. She reciprocates and deliberately says, “Please keep your bags on your seats and sit down.” Students are not able to sit because bags are kept on their seats. Madam Vidya asks, “Why are you not sitting?” The students reply that there is no place to sit because the bags have occupied that space. Continuing the conversation, she provides two identical glass tumblers to two students and encourages them to pour the remaining water from their drinking water bottles into the respective glass tumblers. On pouring water in the glass tumblers, the students observe that one glass tumbler gets half- filled with water (Fig. 6.8a) while the other is almost completely (a) Half-filled (b) Fully-filled filled with water (Fig. 6.8b).

Why is the level of water different in the two tumblers?

Madam Vidya elaborates that both tumblers have the same capacity. The water levels differ in each case, which indicates that the amount of water in each tumbler is different.

The water in the first tumbler occupies less space, indicating that the volume of water in this tumbler is less than the water in the other tumbler. The space occupied by water represents its volume.

Why was I not able to transfer water from the jug into an empty water bottle completely? Now I know the reason behind it ...

properties that are possessed by all materials. Can we give a general name to anything that possesses these two properties? Anything that occupies space and has

mass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter, and the units to measure it are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). The space occupied by matter is its volume. The units to measure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL).

Kilogram is the unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. There is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full stop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the mass, always leave a space between the number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, if we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as 7 kg and not as 7 kgs.

Similarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and millilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ in mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, it would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower case and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for volume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m’. The abbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to 2) denote cubic metre. For example, if you have volume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written Do you as 2 m°.

Objects are made from a large variety of materials. An object can be made up of a single material or a combination of different materials.

We can use different materials to make objects with similar functions.

The method of arranging objects into groups is called classification.

Materials possess different properties which determine their use.

Materials are grouped or classified based on their similarities or differences in their properties.

Materials can be grouped based on appearance, such as lustrous or non-lustrous and based on the feel, such as hard or soft.

Materials are grouped as transparent, translucent or opaque depending on how much we can see through them.

Some materials are soluble in water, while others remain insoluble.

Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter. The space occupied by matter is its volume. Mass quantifies the amount of matter present in an object.

## mu 7.2 Temperature

A reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature than a colder body. The difference in temperature between the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to another body. A device that measures temperature is called a thermometer.

There are two kinds of thermometers that you are likely to come across—clinical thermometers and laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us now learn more about thermometers and how to use them to measure temperature.

For measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers generally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this scale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is denoted by °C.

They are non-contact thermometers, also called infrared thermometers. Such thermometers can measure temperature without touching a person’s body and thus reduce the risk of spreading disease.

The temperature of human beings does not normally go below 35 °C or above 42 °C.

For measuring the body temperature of small children or old people, the digital thermometer can also be placed in the armpit. The temperature measured this way is about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual body temperature.

There is another scale of temperature known as Fahrenheit scale. On this scale, the unit oftemperature is degree Fahrenheit and is denoted by °F. A temperature measured as 37.0 °C on Celsius scale is equivalent to 98.6 °F on Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is not used in most scientific studies anymore. In scientific work, there is another scale of temperature known as Kelvin scale. On this scale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and is denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature is kelvin.

## 7.3.2 Laboratory thermometer

There are many types of laboratory thermometers but the one that might be available in your school laboratory may look like the one shown in Fig. 7.3a. It consists of a long, narrow, uniform glass tube which is sealed. At one end of the tube is a bulb which contains a liquid. Outside the bulb, in the tube, a narrow column of liquid can be seen. There is a Celsius scale marked along the tube. The liquid column rises or falls with change in temperature. The mark of the Celsius scale with which the top level of the liquid column

coincides is the temperature reading.

Fig. 7.3b shows a closeup of a part of the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3a. Can you now find the smallest value that this thermometer can read?

For the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3b, the temperature difference indicated between 0 °C and 10 °C or between 10 °C and 20 °C is 10 °C. And the number of divisions between these marks are 10 divisions. So, one small division can read 10/10 = 1 °C.

That is, the smallest value that this thermometer can read is 1 °C.

Your school laboratory may have thermometers for which the range and the value of the smallest division may be different. It is, therefore, always necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you are about to use.

Do you notice that, as soon as you take the thermometer out of the water, the level of liquid column begins to fall?

This means that the temperature must be read while the thermometer is immersed in water.

Does the maximum and minimum temperature stay at the same level during these days?

Because weather depends on several factors, these temperatures usually vary every day. Generally, as we approach the summer season, the temperature rises and during the winter season it falls.

Anna Mani (1918-2001) was an Indian scientist, also known as the ‘Weather Woman of India’. She invented and built a large number of weather measurement instruments. This reduced the reliance of India on other nations for such instruments. She also explored the possibilities of using wind and solar energy in India. Her work helped India to become one of the global leaders in renewable energy.

The temperature of a body tells us how hot or cold it is.

The three most-used scales of temperature are: (a) the Celsius scale, (b) the Fahrenheit scale, and (c) the Kelvin scale. The units of temperature in these scales are (a) degree Celsius, denoted by °C, (b) degree Fahrenheit, denoted by °F, and (c) kelvin, denoted by K.

The SI unit for temperature is kelvin. A clinical thermometer is used for measuring body temperature.

On a bright summer afternoon, Aavi and Thirav enjoy their shikanji Iemonade). After looking at the ice in the lemonade, Thirav wonders about the nature of ice and water.

No, these are the same substances.

Ice feels hard to touch and we can hold it in our hands, whereas, water cannot be held in the same way. So, they must be different substances.

We can put water in the freezer of a refrigerator and check if it gets converted into ice.

Yes, I know when water is left in the freezer, it gets converted into ice but probably something gets added to the ice in the freezer.

Do you think Thirav is right? How can you find out?

¢ Put anice cube ina cup, leave it on the table and observe.

Ice gets converted into water. What can you conclude from the observations?

Does this mean that ice and water are the same substance? Yes, ice and water are the two forms of the same substance. These forms are also called states. These different states of water show many differences in their behaviour. Water flows but ice does not. Water splashes but ice does not.


## ees 8.1 Investigating Water’s Disappearing Act

It is a rainy morning. While going to school, Aavi and Thirav observe that there are a lot of water puddles in the playground. That evening, when they go to play, they are surprised to observe that some of the water in the puddles had disappeared.

Have you ever noticed water in the puddles disappearing? Where does it go? Discuss with

Where else have you seen water disappearing? Can you think of a possible reason why this happens?

You might have observed that after washing the utensils, water left on the surface of the utensils, dries up after some time. Does the reason you thought earlier

to explain water disappearance apply in this case also?

Aavi wonders if water has seeped through the surface of the utensils.

Thirav thinks that water does not seep through the surface of the utensils. Design an activity to investigate whose idea is correct.

@ Keep observing this at regular intervals until the water completely disappears.

What do you infer? Is this activity enough to come to the conclusion that water does not seep through a steel plate?

If water does not seep through the steel plate. Then, where has the water gone?

This water gets converted into gaseous state called water vapour. The water vapour is another state of water. Let us think of another observation where you notice the water disappearing.

While making dosa, we sprinkle some water on the hot pan and it disappears. Where does it go?


## Fig. 8.1: Steel plate with a tablespoon of water

Let us draw

Draw a detailed sketch (with labels and caption) about what happens to the water.

The water which is sprinkled on the hot pan gets converted into steam. Steam is actually water vapour, some part of which converts into water droplets.

The process of conversion of water into its vapour state is called evaporation.

The process of evaporation takes place continuously, even at room temperature. Can you think of other examples of evaporation?

Drying of wet clothes, mopped floor, and sweat on our body are some examples of it.

Nowwhat doyouthinkis the reason for the disappearance of water from the puddles? Is it due to: (i) seeping of water into the ground or (ii) evaporation of water or (iii) both of these?

One observation that arises in Aavi’s mind is, “There are some water droplets (tiny drops) appearing on the outer surface of the glass tumbler.” Initially, water droplets are deposited and these droplets combine together to form bigger drops. You can also try the above process with a metal container. You may be curious about where the water droplets come from.

Continue the discussion on the given reasons or conduct activities to find evidence for the reasons given to help in this discussion. Where else have you seen water droplets like this?

You might have seen dew drops on plants. Why do we see dew drops more in the morning? When we boil the water in a half-filled utensil and cover it with a steel plate, some water drops accumulate on the inner side of the steel plate. Where do these water drops come from? What do you think?

When the water vapour present in the air comes in contact with a cold surface, it forms water droplets. The process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid state is called condensation.

After understanding the concept of condensation of water, let us go back to Activity 8.3. Could the water appearing on the outer surface of the glass tumbler in Activity 8.3 also be due to condensation of water vapour present in the air? Let us investigate it.

Do your findings match with your predictions? Explain your observations.

You may observe some water droplets on the glass tumbler. Water vapour from the air comes in contact with the cold surface of the glass tumbler and gets converted into water droplets on the glass tumbler through condensation. There is an increase in the reading on the digital weighing balance. Can we conclude that water is not seeping through the wall of the tumbler? Can we also conclude that the water collected outside the tumbler is only due to condensation? No, we cannot say that conclusively from Activity 8.4. What more can you do to show that water is not seeping from the glass tumbler? How would you modify Activity 8.4 to find the answer?


## Repeat Activity 8.4 with the following modifications—

@ Mark the water level on the glass tumbler with a permanent marker or a visible tape.

from this? This activity shows that water is not seeping from the glass tumbler and the extra water is getting collected because of condensation.

ees §. 3 What are the Different States of Water?

Water is a substance that can be observed in three different states in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On heating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. On further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous state. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties of different states of water.


## Activity 8.5: Let us identify EEE

What are the differences in the properties of water in solid, liquid and gaseous states?

Ice (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the container in which it is placed while water takes the shape of the container. Ice does not flow or spread.

Water (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water does not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the container in which itis kept, but the volume of water remains constant. Does water also possess the property to spread? Yes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the volume constant.

Water vapour (gaseous state) exhibits a property of spreading out in the entire available space. Gases do not possess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room temperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the air around us. The water that evaporates during processes like drying of clothes or mopping of floors contribute to the water vapour in the air around us.

You are now familiar with the three states of water. Some other substances also exhibit these states. For example, wax, oil and ghee. Let us look at some more examples of solids, liquids and gases.

Look around and find some examples of solid substances. Some examples could be stones, wood and glass.

What are the other examples of liquids you can think of? Here are two examples—milk and oil. Think of five more examples.

Have you ever noticed that you can smell the food being cooked even without entering the kitchen? How does this smell reach us?

It is because the smell of yummy food from cooking spreads through the air and reaches our nostrils, even if we are not in the kitchen.

What are the other examples of gases you can think of? What about oxygen and carbon dioxide?


## 8.4 How can We Change the States of Water?

So far we have learnt that water can exist in solid, liquid and gaseous states. How can you change the state of water?

How can you quickly change ice to its liquid state, water?

If we have to change ice into water, and water into water vapour, we have to supply

heat to it. If we want to change Q water into ice, what should be done?

It can be done by placing water in a cold environment, such as a freezer. Water freezes and is

converted into ice. If we take the ice out of the freezer, it melts and is converted into water.

Can you think of any other example, besides water, that can change from solid to liquid?

A candle, which is made of wax, is one such example.

How can we turn candle wax into liquid state? How can we change the liquid wax back into solid state? We should cool the liquid wax to change it into a solid. What are the other liquids you have seen which get converted into a solid? Have you ever seen coconut oil getting converted into its solid state during the winter season?

Hence, we can see that water and other substances change their states on heating or cooling. The process of conversion of a solid into liquid state is called melting. The process of conversion of liquid into solid state is called freezing.

Let us check the connection between different states of water through Activity 8.6.

## mum 8.7 How Do Clouds Give Us Rain?

Condensation plays a significant role in the process of bringing evaporated water back to the Earth’s surface. How does this happen? When air moves higher above the Earth’s surface, it becomes cooler and cooler. At certain heights, the air gets so cool that the water vapour in it turns into droplets which are generally formed around dust particles. These small droplets float in the air and form clouds. Many droplets join together to form bigger drops of water. Some drops get so heavy that they start falling. These falling water drops are what we call rain.

Malli and his sister Valli are excited for their summer vacations. Their parents have planned a trip to visit their relatives and friends living across India. They always stay in touch with their relatives and friends. Do you also keep in touch with your loved ones?

Their first halt is at their Nani’s (maternal grandmother’s) house in Haryana. It is surrounded by large fields. Malli and Valli are fascinated by the variety of grains piled up in the courtyard. Their Mami (maternal aunt) and Mama (maternal uncle), along with other community members, are busy separating small stones and husk from the grains with their hands. 17

Malli and Valli are curious to know why this is being done. Their Nani notices their curiosity and explains, “We are removing these stones so that the grains are fit for cooking.”

They go around the house to see the fields and the cattle. To keep them busy, Nani gives them a challenge of handpicking small stones from grains while keeping their eyes closed.

The method of picking by hand from a mixture (when two or more substances are mixed) such as small stones and husk from wheat and rice is called handpicking. It is done on the basis of differences in size, colour and shape of the particles. If the particles to be removed are present in small quantities and can easily be picked by hand, handpicking » proves to be a convenient method.

At lunch, Malli and Valli are served steaming hot vegetable pulao. While eating the pulao, Nani observes that Malli is separating whole black peppers

from the pulao and is placing them Fig. 9.1; Handpicking aside on his plate (Fig. 9.1). Valli playfully teases, “Wow! This is a handpicking method, nice one!” Nani tells them about the benefits of black pepper and

; encourages Malli to eat it. ae Later in the day, their Mama takes them to the fields : where they observe bundles of harvested wheat stalks lying in the fields. Some stalks are spread in the sun for drying. Both of them pick up a stalk each and notice numerous grains attached to it. A group of farmers are beating the stalks on a large wooden log. Curiously, Valli asks Mama, “Why are they doing this?”

Mama explains, “They are beating

the stalks to separate the grains” (Fig. - 9.2). This process of separating grains Fig. 9.2: Threshing from the stalks is known as threshing. Farmers work hard, yet they enjoy their work. From time to time, J

You observe that blowing air separates the heavier and the lighter components.

How do you think farmers separate so many grains from husk?

Traditionally, a soop (bamboo tray) is used for separating heavier and lighter components of a mixture (Fig. 9.3).

Next day, their Nana takes them to the fields to show this process at work.

Malli and Valli observe a farmer standing on a raised platform. The farmer is moving the bamboo tray which contains threshed wheat grains in the direction of air or wind (Fig. 9.4).

What do you infer from Fig. 9.4? Do both the components, wheat grains and husk, fall at the same place? Which of the two components get blown away? Can the wind separate the two components?

After obtaining some water in the container, she noticed that the water was muddy and fit/unfit for drinking. To purify the water, she kept it for some time and then she filtered/ churned the muddy water using a piece of paper/muslin cloth. Leela, then, cooled/boiled the water for about 10 minutes in a covered pan. After cooling/boiling, she filtered/churned it again and made it fit/unfit for drinking. She served this water to her father while having food, who blessed her and appreciated her efforts.

You may have identified movement as one of the similarities among living beings. You have also seen cars moving on a road. Does it mean that a car is living? List the

tasks that you can do but a car cannot. You are a wonderful example of a living being. Whenever you attempt to group things around you as living or non-living, you can compare them with yourself. Which characteristics help you in differentiating yourself from a car? For instance, a car does not grow. Does it mean it is non-living? Now, which characteristics have you used to classify a car as non-living? Continue your discussion in a similar way to identify the essential characteristics of living beings.

What are some common characteristics that make living beings very different from the non-living things? Let us learn about them.

Can we consider movementas one of the characteristics to differentiate between the living and the non-living? List five things around you that can move on their own. Do you think that all five things that you have listed can be considered as living just because they can move on their own? However, unlike animals, plants do not move from one place to another. Do you consider them as living?

Even though plants do not move from one place to another, they do show certain types of movements. Opening of flowers is one of the examples of movementin plants. Another example of movement in plants is seen in insectivorous plants. Insectivorous Drosera plants are dependent on insects for their nutrition. Drosera is one of the examples of an insectivorous plant. Drosera is featured with saucer-shaped leaves having many hair-like projections of unequal length with sticky ends. Whenever an insect enters the saucer, hairs move inward and trap the insect with their sticky ends. Try to observe the mechanism of movement in other insectivorous plants. Climbers also wind themselves around any object placed close to them. That means, even though plants do not move from one place to another, they do show some movements.

wear the dress that you used to wear four years ago? No, because you have become larger in size. This is due to growth in your body. Plants and other living beings also grow. Can we consider growth as a characteristic of living beings?

Living beings need food (nutrition) for their growth and development. List five living beings that require food to grow.

Now, think of a process without which we cannot live. Count the number of breaths you take per minute after a normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. Record the data and observe. Do you notice any difference in the number of breaths after each situation? Do you notice the process of breathing in other animals like dogs, cats, cows and buffaloes? Notice the movement of their abdomen while they are taking rest.

In the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air moves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe out, the air moves from inside our body to outside. Breathing is part of a process called respiration. Do plants also respire? There are tiny pores called stomata on the surface of leaves. These pores help plants in taking air in and out. Interact with senior class students in your school and request if they can demonstrate stomata using a microscope in your class. All living beings respire.

Have you noticed white patches forming on shirts around the armpits during summers? These patches are formed due to sweat. The sweat consists of water and salts removed by the body as waste products. Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion. Urine is also formed as a product of excretion in animals. Do you know that plants also excrete? You may notice plants excrete excess water and minerals in the form of small droplets on leaves. For example, grasses and roses. All living beings excrete.

Let us look at another characteristic. What is your reaction if you unexpectedly

Water droplets on grass step on a sharp object, such as a thorn,

## Chapter 10.indd 187

while walking without shoes, or you accidentally touch a hot cup of tea? Stepping on a thorn and touching a hot object are stimuli. Any thing or any event that prompts living beings to respond is called a stimulus. List three stimuli (plural of stimulus) and your body’s instant response to them.

Do plants also respond to stimuli? Yes, plants also respond to stimuli. For example, touch- me-not (mimosa, chhui-mui, lajjalu) plants fold their leaves when we touch them. Have you also observed that certain plants fold their leaves after sunset? Specifically, the leaves of certain plants facing each other tend to come together. This can be observed in the sleeping leaves of amla (Indian gooseberry) tree. All living beings respond to stimuli. Find a few more plants in your neighbourhood which fold their leaves after sunset.

Why do the leaves of chhui-mui and amla plants respond in this way? Which stimulus could be responsible for their behaviour?

Have you seen young ones of cats, dogs or other animals? List young ones of five different animals. Have you seen young ones of any non-living things such as a pencil, a chair or an electric bulb?

All living beings reproduce. Reproduction is the process of producing new ones of one’s own kind. Why is reproduction necessary? It is necessary for the continuity of life.

When a living being is not able to exhibit all of the above mentioned characteristics, despite the availability of all resources (like food, air and water) needed for being alive, it is said to be dead.

From the above discussion, we can understand that all living beings share some common characteristics. For example, all living beings show movement, they need

Have you observed a seed germinating? You might have wondered what conditions are required for germination of a seed. What conditions do you think are required for seed germination? How will you investigate whether these conditions have an effect on the germination of a seed?

Let us find out by performing Activity 10.2.

@ Regularly observe the pots for 7-10 days to check the status of germination of the seeds. Record your observations in Table 10.2.


## ¢ Compare your predictions with your observations.

Do you think sunlight is necessary for germination of seeds? Do the seeds in all the pots receive air, water and sunlight? Is there any pot in which air is not available to the seeds? If so, why is it not available? What happens to the seeds in the pot where water is provided in excess? Which seeds receive both air and water? Identify the pots where you can notice the germination of seeds.

Do your observations match with your predictions? Write possible reasons in favour of your observations in Table 10.2. Based on your observations, state the conditions which favour seed germination.

Which of the following are essential for seed germination— air, water and sunlight? Compare the available conditions in each pot. Germination of bean seeds requires the right amount of water and air. Why do seeds require these conditions for germination? Do you think that the absence of one or more of these conditions will affect seed germination?

Let us understand how these conditions help in seed germination. The effects of the following conditions have been seen in Activity 10.2.

Water: Seeds require water for germination. Water enables the seeds to carry out the processes necessary for their growth. The outer covering of the seed is called seed coat. Water softens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo inside it to develop into a plant.

Air and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the air available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, spaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily.

Light and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for the bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their germination. In general, most seeds do not require light for germination. But after germination, sunlight is required for further growth of the seedling.

Jagadish Chandra Bose (1858-1937) was an Indian scientist who did some fascinating experiments with plants. He built a machine called a crescograph to record how plants respond to stimuli like light, heat, electricity and gravity. With this machine, he could measure how fast plants grow. He also showed that plants can sense and respond to stimuli.

Go through the observations you recorded regarding the growth of the bean plant in Table 10.4. What changes do you observe after the fruits are formed? Does the plant become yellow and dry even when you continue watering it? Sow the seeds obtained from your bean plant. Watch how the seeds give rise to a new generation of bean plants. Compare the sketches that you have drawn in Table 10.4 with Fig. 10.4. A seed grows into a young plant and matures to produce flowers and fruit. The fruit, in this case a pod, contains seeds which give rise to a new generation of bean plants. The entire process from a seed to a plant, and then, to the next generation of seeds is called the life cycle of a plant (Fig. 10.4). When a plant stops growing and all activities of life gradually come to an end, even after the availability of all the necessary conditions, the plant is considered dead.

## 10.5.1 Life cycle of a mosquito

Mosquitoes buzzing around is acommon experience for all of us. Female mosquitoes are bloodsucking insects that transmit several diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya. You might have learnt from newspapers, school noticeboards or awareness campaigns that mosquito breeding should be prevented. We are advised not to allow water to stagnate anywhere in our surroundings. Why is it so? Does stagnant water have any relation with mosquitoes laying eggs?


## Reprint 2025-26

10/4/2024 3:11:38 PM

Conduct a safety audit in your school, or at your home and surroundings to check for stagnant water (if available, carry a hand lens to observe any small creatures). Some common places where stagnant water is likely to gather are desert coolers, planted pots and any open container. You may find two different types of worm-like creatures (Fig. 10.5). They are larva and pupa, two distinct life stages during the development of mosquito. In case you observe larvae and pupae, report to your teacher. Discuss with the teacher and classmates about the necessary measures one can take to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. What differences do you observe in the shape of larvae and pupae?


## Fig. 10.5: Larvae and pupae of mosquitoes in a stagnant water body

Mosquito larvae and pupae observed in water bodies repeatedly come to the water surface. What can be the reason for this? Mosquito larvae and pupae live in water and require air to respire. They move to the surface of the water for air.

## Characteristics

Kerosene oil forms a thin layer over the water surface. This layer separates water from air, and does not allow larvae and pupae to inhale air. Asa result, they die.

## Activity 10.5: Let us analys©

Let us solve an interesting puzzle.

How will you decide which stage (larva or pupa) comes immediately after the egg stage?

Suppose you are given a container with water from a puddle containing larvae and pupae. Design an activity to find out the correct sequence of these stages.

You can take help of the following activity designed by Avadhi to create your own activity—

Step 1: Ihave a water container with mosquito larvae and pupae.

Step 2: I will separate 4-5 larvae and pupae into two separate containers with the same water.

Step 3: I will observe them every day until I see them changing to the next stage.

Step 4: Ifthe larvae change into pupae, it would mean that the larval stage comes before the pupal stage or vice-versa.

Step 5: I will keep watching both the containers to see in which one a mosquito appears first.

These observations will help us to learn the correct sequence of growth.

Now, suppose you are given a container filled with water from a puddle which contains larvae and pupae. Without separating them from the container, how would you design an activity to decide which stage, out of the two, gives way to the next?

Let us learn more about these stages in the life cycle of a mosquito.

Mosquitoes pass through four stages in their life cycle— egg, larva, pupa and adult (Fig. 10.6).

The adult mosquito that emerges from the pupa rests briefly on the surface of water and then flies away. The adult mosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days.

We have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg (stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage ID), the larva grows into pupa (stage IID, and the pupa transforms into an adult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays eggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues.

Significant changes occur in the appearance, body shape and structure during the various stages in the life cycle of a mosquito. The shape of the egg is quite different from the larva; the larva appears very different from the pupa. The pupa appears very distinct from the adult mosquito. Is it easy to imagine that a mosquito emerges from a pupa?

Some of the stages have been clubbed together, for example, stages A and F in Fig. 10.7 have been kept under stage I. You will find four stages in the life cycle of a frog— the egg stage, which progresses to the embryo stage; the tadpole stage, consisting of an early stage with a tail and no legs, and a late stage with hind legs; the froglet stage, and the adult frog stage (Fig. 10.8).

@ Which stage has the shortest duration?

@ Is there a change in the habitat during the various stages in the life cycle of a frog?

¢ How do the special features support that stage?

Observe Fig. 10.8. You will see that tadpoles develop legs but still have tails. Tails help them swim in water. Tadpoles grow gradually and start looking like little frogs called froglets. They still live in water but begin to spend some time on land. They continue to grow and lose their tails completely. Their legs become strong to help them jump and land. They become fully developed adult frogs who live both in water and on land.

Do you think that birds also show significant changes in the various stages of their life cycle?

How does the life cycle of animals differ from that of plants?

Plants and animals are a part of the living world. They go through various changes during the course of their lives. We have learnt that a tiny plant grows and develops into a big tree. We have also learnt how animals grow and change from young ones to adults. This journey varies for each animal, making it unique and special. We have seen pupae change into insects, and tadpoles change into frogs. Such changes are important for plants and animals to survive and to maintain continuity of their kind. We should also take care of them and their homes. By nurturing and preserving their homes, we contribute to this flourishing living world.

The objects around us can be categorised into two types living and non-living. The essential features of living beings are that they move, eat, grow, breathe, excrete, respond to stimuli, reproduce and die. Absence of any of these features indicates that they are not living beings.

Each living being goes through several stages during its life.

Germination of seeds depends upon the availability of water, air and suitable light and/or dark conditions.

During germination of seeds, roots generally grow downwards, while shoots grow upwards.

A plant’s life cycle starts with seed germination, followed by several stages of its growth and development. These include flowering and seed production. Seeds produced during their life cycle would germinate into new plants and the cycle continues.

The life cycle of an animal as a result of reproduction, begin with a newborn that undergoes various stages of growth and development followed by an adult stage and finally death. The process of reproduction maintains the continuity of its kind.

Mosquitoes pass through the stages of egg, larva, pupa and adult. The life stages of a frog include eggs, tadpoles, froglets and adults.

In some living beings, such as mosquitoes and frogs, significant changes occur during the various stages of their life cycles. These changes can be seen in body shape, structure and sometimes even in the habitat.

## 1 Nature’s Treasures

School vacations are always fun for Bhoomi and Surya. This vacation, they visit their Ajji (grandmother). Ajji lives in a village on the edge of a forest in the Western Ghats. The air in the village is fresh and cooler than in the city. They can see beautiful hills, streams, and many interesting plants, animals and birds around them.

One afternoon, Bhoomi and Surya ask Ajji to tell them more about the place. Ajji says, “Children, do you know that this place has several treasures of nature that enrich our lives? The pure air is refreshing and the soil is so fertile that it supports a variety of living beings. Moreover, this place gets plenty of sunlight which is useful in many ways. Different varieties of trees provide food and shelter to animals including various birds and insects. Can you think of more such treasures of nature?”

Bhoomi replies, “Ajji, we use water for drinking and growing vegetables.” Ajji says, “Yes. We need these treasures for our survival and for making our lives more comfortable. Without these treasures of nature, any form of life on Earth is not possible.” We all are a part of nature.

Ajji explains the importance of air around us and how it is essential for our survival. Let us find out more about air.

One morning, Bhoomi and Surya see Ajji performing some _ breathing exercises. Ajji asks them to join her. She says, “Iam taking deep breaths in, and letting them out. This helps in getting more fresh air in the lungs to stay healthy.” Bhoomi and Surya sit with Ajji and start taking deep breaths.

Let us also perform a breathing exercise.

Do you know?

The air which surrounds the Earth is a mixture of gases. Can you name some gases which are present in the air? Air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and other gases in small quantities. Fig. 11.1 gives the composition ofair in percentage. Notice that in Fig. 11.1 there are 100 squares. Out of 100 squares, 78 are occupied by nitrogen, 21 are occupied by oxygen, and 1 by argon, carbon dioxide and other gases.

You notice the presence of air when the leaves of a tree rustle, the clothes hanging on a clothes line sway, or the pages of an open book begin to flutter once a fan is switched on.

Moving air is called wind. Sometimes it blows fast, for example, during a storm, and sometimes it blows gently as a breeze. You must have played with a firki (paper pinwheel) many times. Let us make a firki by performing Activity 11.2.

Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji in filling the troughs of water for the cows. They also help her in watering plants such as vegetables and medicinal herbs in the garden. Ajji teaches them how to water the plants so that every drop is used and none of it goes waste.

Can you think of some more uses of water in your daily life? Write down your responses in the

We need water for drinking.

We need water for many daily activities, such as drinking, cooking, bathing, washing and cleaning. It is also used for growing crops and for industrial purposes. Where do we get water from? Make a list of the different sources of water.

Water covers about two-thirds of the Earth’s surface. Most of the water is found in oceans and seas. However, this water is saline or salty. This saline water is not fit for domestic, agricultural and industrial use. For all these activities, we need freshwater, which is present in the form of ice sheets or snow, rivers or lakes on the surface of the Earth, and underground. Freshwater present in ice sheets

Identify other human activities that lead to water pollution. Discuss with your friends in the class what you can do to reduce water pollution. Polluted water is not fit for consumption by living beings.

As freshwater sources are limited, there is a shortage of water in many parts of India. At some places, people have to walk long distances to fetch drinking water. Everyone does not have the same kind of access to water. It is important for us to conserve water and use it judiciously. We must also prevent it from being polluted so that water remains fit for consumption by all living beings. In what ways can you conserve water?

Water harvesting is one of the methods for conserving water. In many buildings, rainwater is collected and stored in large quantities for later use. This is called rainwater harvesting (Fig. 11.4a). Do you know that rainwater is also harvested in many homes, residential societies or schools? It is an age-old practice in India.

For example, stepwells (Fig. 11.4b), commonly known as Bawadi in Rajasthan and Vav in Gujarat are built for water harvesting as a response to the scarcity of water in these regions. These stepwells have a unique system of water harvesting. They store not only rainwater but also water seeping from nearby lakes, ponds and rivers. The walls of the trenches (long deep holes dug in the ground) are lined with blocks of stones that allow seepage of water. Find traditional water harvesting practices in your locality. Discuss with your teachers and parents to learn more about it.

## 11.3 Energy from the Sun

On a sunny day, Bhoomi and Surya are helping Ajji dry chillies in the Sun. Ajji says, “We use the heat from the Sun to dry it. We can use dried chillies when fresh ones are not available. I will give you some to take home. Do you know that the Sun is the main source of energy on Earth? All plants and animals are dependent on it.”

We use heat and light from the Sun for various purposes. What are some of the activities for which we need heat and light? Bhoomi draws some pictures to show the uses of heat and light from the Sun. Help her by adding more examples. Draw the pictures and write their descriptions in the space provided.

One cannot imagine life on Earth without the Sun. The Sun is the main source of energy on the Earth. Plants get energy from the Sun and produce food. Animals eat plants and grow. We get food from both plants and animals. This cycle on Earth is possible due to the Sun. So, we all are dependent on the Sun as the main source of energy. Where do we find a large variety of plants or animals? Let us explore.

One morning, Ajji takes Bhoomi and Surya for a walk in the forest. They find a variety of herbs, shrubs and trees in the forest. Ajji explains, “Forests are large areas with dense growth of various types of plants.” On the way, they collect some nellikai (Kannada term for Indian gooseberries) that have fallen on the ground. Ajji tells them, “We have a tradition in the village not to pluck fruits from the trees; they are left for animals and birds to eat.”

Forests are a natural home for many wild animals, including birds and insects. Forests provide food and shelter to them. In nature, every animal depends on other life forms for survival. The diversity of life forms ensures food for every living being. However, over the years, the forest cover has been decreasing, mainly due to human activities like large scale cutting of trees. It takes many years to grow a new forest or restore lost forests. Therefore, we must preserve and use forests responsibly so that they get enough time to regenerate.

During their walk in the forests, Bhoomi and Surya notice that there are a lot of leaves on the ground and the soil feels damp. Ajji explains, “The roots of plants hold on to the soil and prevent it from being washed away. The leaves that fall from the trees decay and enrich the soil with nutrients. This soil is used by new plants and trees to grow. This is an example of recycling in nature.” Let us investigate the soil in more detail.


## ees | 15 Soil, Rocks and Minerals

Bhoomi, Surya and Ajji come back home from the forest. Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji in preparing the soil in the garden for planting some vegetables (Fig. 11.5). Ajji asks them to dig the soil gently and loosen the lumps. You have already learnt in the chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’ that for plants Fig. 11.5: Soil preparation for to grow, the space between the planting vegetables soil particles not only provides sufficient air but also space for the roots to grow easily.

There are many things in the soil, such as sand, insects and worms. There may be many small organisms that we cannot see with our naked eyes. Plants and animals also become part of the soil as they decompose and decay. The soil samples collected from different places may be of different colours because they may contain different materials.

Have you ever wondered how soil is formed? Soil is formed by the disintegration (breaking apart) of rocks by actions of the Sun, water and living organisms over a long time (thousands of years). There are different types of soils. Some are good for growing certain types of Ploughing

You may have seen rocks in your surroundings. Rocks are used in the construction of houses, buildings, temples, roads, dams and table tops. Some rocks, like slate, are used for roofing (Fig. 11.6) and laterite can be used as a building material, like bricks (Fig. 11.7). Some of the important rocks are granite, sandstone and marble. Human beings have been using rocks to make tools such as hand axes (Fig. 11.8a) and arrowheads (Fig. 11.8b) since thousands of years.

What are the most common types of fuels used? Petrol and diesel are the two most widely used fuels for vehicles. Petrol, diesel and kerosene are obtained from petroleum. Petroleum along with natural gas and coal are commonly called fossil fuels. They are formed essentially from the remains of microorganisms and plants that got buried deep inside the earth, and were converted to petroleum, natural gas and coal. It takes millions of years for these fuels to form.

Natural gas is used for cooking and generating electricity. Nowadays, it is also used in the form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as a fuel for vehicles. It is a cleaner fuel than petrol or diesel. Coal is mainly used for the production of electricity. It is found in several parts of India. Find out the major coal-producing states and mark them in a map of India.

Fossil fuels are found in limited quantities. Hence, we will soon run out of fossil fuels if we continue to use them in the manner that we currently do. To avoid such a situation, we need to explore alternate sources of energy. When fossil fuels are burnt, smoke and carbon dioxide gas are produced which pollutes the air. Over-dependence on fossil fuels for transportation and as domestic fuels has resulted in large scale air pollution.

Let us do our bit to conserve the fossil fuels by— @ Walking or cycling to nearby places.

@ Using public transport. Suggest some more ways.


## 11.7 Natural Resources: Renewable and Non-renewable

Nature’s treasures fulfill our needs. They are essential resources to sustain all life forms on the Earth. For example, we get heat and light from the Sun, water from rivers, and food from plants and animals. These resources which we get from nature are called natural resources. We also use natural resources to make many useful things for our convenience. For example, electric bulbs, furniture, solar panels, bicycles, etc., make our lives comfortable. All such resources created by human beings are called human-made resources.

You have learnt about various natural resources, such as air, water, energy from the Sun, forests, soil, rocks, minerals and fossil fuels. Some of these natural resources

get replenished through natural processes over a period of time. If you remember, Ajji told Bhoomi and Surya that they could collect only those nellikai that had fallen on the ground. This makes sure that there would be enough fruits for other animals and birds. The seeds from the droppings of animals and birds would enable new trees to grow, though it would take some years before we get fruits from these new trees. Thus, resources which get renewed, replenished or restored within a reasonable period of time are called renewable resources. Air, water and forest are some of the examples of renewable natural resources. Nature renews them. We should use our natural resources judiciously.

On the other hand, fossil fuels take millions of years to form. They are found in limited quantities and once used, they get exhausted. They are not produced or replenished within a reasonable period of time. These resources are called non-renewable resources. Examples of non-renewable natural resources are minerals, soil, rocks, coal, petroleum and natural gas.


## 11.8 Resources We Use

It is time for Bhoomi and Surya to go back home after a wonderful holiday at their Ajji’s home. Their Amma (mother) comes to pick them up. Bhoomi and Surya show her the vegetable plants that have started to grow in the garden and the dried chillies given by Ajji to take home.

They notice changes in the colour of the skyline and the smell of the air once they reach the city. There are very few trees. The air does not smell as good as the air at Ajji’s place.

You and your friends have listed many natural resources that we use everyday. These resources are air, water, soil, and food from plants and animals. We get these resources from nature and also make things using them for our consumption. Therefore, we must conserve our natural resources and use them responsibly without wasting them. This way, we can continue to fulfill our present needs while also saving for the future, without harming the environment.

Resources required for our survival are provided by nature. Resources provided by nature are called natural resources. Some important natural resources are air, water, energy from the Sun, forests, soil, rocks, minerals and fossil fuels. Resources created by human beings to meet their needs are called human-made resources.

Natural resources can be classified as renewable resources and non-renewable resources.

Resources that get renewed, replenished or restored by natural processes within a reasonable period are called renewable resources.

Resources that are in limited quantities and do not get replenished within a reasonable period are called non-renewable resources.

All living beings, including humans, depend on natural resources for their survival so we should use them judiciously.

## 12.1 Stars and Constellations

At night, when we look up at the sky, we see many stars. Some stars are bright and others are dim. Stars shine with their own light.

Some groups of stars appear to form patterns which are like shapes of familiar things. Long ago, when watching stars in the night sky was a favourite pastime of our ancestors, they identified these star patterns with animals, things or characters in stories. Many cultures had names for patterns based on their own stories. These imaginary shapes helped them in recognising stars in the sky.

Recognising stars and their patterns was a useful skill for navigation in the olden times. Before the arrival of modern technology or even before the invention of the magnetic compass, it helped people, particularly sailors and travellers, in finding directions at sea or on land. It is still used in emergencies as a backup method.

In earlier times, groups of stars forming patterns were called constellations. Currently, the regions of sky, which include these groups of stars, are defined as constellations. However, since in constellations, the patterns of stars are often the most prominent, the term constellation is still commonly used for these groups of stars.

## ee | 22 Night Sky Watching

If it is a clear cloudless night, a large number of stars may be visible in the sky. If you stay in a big city, you may find that the sky is rarely clear and only a few stars are seen in the night sky. This is due to light pollution, smoke and dust. The presence of excessive artificial light at night time is referred to as light pollution. In villages or areas where there is less light pollution, a larger number of stars can be seen. Also, your house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees, which may block your view. The night sky is best viewed from open dark areas.

Not all stars and constellations are visible from all places on Earth and on all nights in a year. For example, the Pole Star is not visible from the southern hemisphere of Earth. To identify a star or a constellation, you need to know how a particular constellation looks like and where to look for it in the night sky. To get familiar with the pattern of a constellation you may use images such as Fig. 12.3 and Fig. 12.4. _ To find out when and in which portion of the sky a star or ~ a constellation will be visible from your location, you may take the help of sky mapping apps that can be downloaded on a mobile phone, or other online resources.

## Preparation for night sky watching


## od

Under the guidance of adults, identify a dark open area for night sky watching. This should be away from lights, tall buildings and trees.

Choose the date and time based upon what you plan to identify in the night sky.

Choose a moonless night with no clouds, particularly for the Pole Star which is not very bright.

It may be useful to have access to a mobile app with a sky map, or print out images of the constellations you plan to view. You may also carry a magnetic compass to find directions and a notebook to note or draw your observations.

On the particular day and time selected, go to the identified place with an adult, where the night sky watching is to be done.

After reaching there, wait for about half an hour for your eyes to get adjusted to the darkness. This will help you to see the night sky better (Fig. 12.5).

Venus is usually seen shining brightly at dawn and dusk, and is commonly called the Morning Star or the Evening Star, even though it is not a star. Mars is called the Red Planet because it appears red. This is because the soil on Mars is reddish in colour.

A large portion of the Earth’s surface is covered with water and thus, it appears blue from the space. Due to this, the Earth is also called the Blue Planet.

The four outermost planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—are much larger compared to the Earth, and are mostly made of gases. These giant gaseous planets have large flat ring-like structures around them which are made of dust particles and rocky material.

Planets get most of their energy from the Sun. So, the farther they are, the colder they are in general. The presence of an atmosphere on a planet can trap heat which can significantly change the temperature of a planet. That is why Venus, for example, is hotter than Mercury, although it is farther from the Sun.

While many of the objects in the sky can be seen with our naked eyes directly, we can see them brighter and larger using a pair of binoculars or an instrument called a telescope (Fig. 12.8). A telescope also helps us view many dim objects not visible by our naked eyes directly.

Many comets have been found that revolve around the Sun. These comets approach close to the Sun periodically. However, there are a few comets that escape and move out of the Solar System. Few other comets get broken up, or fall into the Sun or other planets when they approach them.

We have learnt about the objects which form the Solar System. Which are these objects? The Sun, eight planets, their moons, and many smaller objects including asteroids, and comets, together form the Solar System.

The Sun—our star—is the largest and the heaviest object in the Solar System. The Sun produces almost all the energy in the Solar System. All other objects in our Solar System shine due to the sunlight that they reflect from their surfaces.

You can see stars fading away at dawn and appearing at dusk. During the day we do not see the stars. Explain why.

During a clear night, try to observe the Big Dipper 3-4 times at an interval of 2 to 3 hours. Also try to locate the Pole Star each time. Does the Big Dipper appear to move? Draw a rough sketch to illustrate this, mentioning the time in each case.

Think about the night sky and write a poem or a story on it.

Learning further

Try to find out the names of planets in your local language. Also, find out the stories associated with stars and constellations in your region. Present these stories in a pictorial form.

If there is a planetarium or a science museum nearby, then you can visit it, especially if a night sky observation session is scheduled by them. You will get to see the Moon, the planets and the stars through a telescope. If you visit the planetarium during daytime, you can also see their models, pictures and sky shows.

Find out if the increasing light pollution is causing problems for humans, wildlife and the environment. Write an action that you would take at the personal level to control light pollution.

Find out the weather conditions due to which the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) found Hanle, Ladakh a suitable place to set up an observatory.

If you enjoy doing embroidery, try to embroider on a dark coloured cloth the constellations that you have seen (Fig. 12.15). Otherwise, you may use your creativity and depict constellations in multiple other ways using various art and craft ideas.

Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, is situated atop the highest peak of Digpa- ratsa-Ri mountain range in Hanle. This peak has been renamed Mount Saraswati.

It has several telescopes. One of them is called the Himalayan Chandra Telescope, which has been named after the Nobel

ty Prize winning scientist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. It is an

It is not the end, my friend!

This might be the last page of this book, but it is certainly not the end of our ‘Curiosity’. The title of this book not only drives our journey through the amazing world of science, but also defines what it means to be human. As a species, we are curious. We want to find out more about the world we live in and worlds beyond. By now, you have perhaps read a little bit about the world of plants and animals, done some fun activities, learnt about how we measure, wondered about the stars that shine in the night sky, and so on. But remember, this is just the beginning. Science is a never-ending adventure, with new discoveries coming up all the time. And as you progress through the Middle Stage, the things you come across will help you find out even more about the world around you. The key lies in that curiosity you have nurtured throughout this journey. Keep observing the world around you, keep asking questions, and do not be afraid to experiment. Remember, even the most groundbreaking discoveries often begin with a simple “Why?”. There are countless questions waiting to be answered, and countless answers waiting to be questioned. You, my young scientist, can find them out. So, go forth and explore! And see you again in the next Grade for more adventures in science!
