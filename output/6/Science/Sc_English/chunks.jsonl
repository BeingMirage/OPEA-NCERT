The policy advocates a radical shift from a content-based education to a competency-based education, particularly in the realm of science. Therefore, the formulation of curricular goals for Science, subsequent competencies and learning outcomes are tailored towards competency-based learning. These curricular goals encompass various scientific concepts, including matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the exploration of the interface between science, society and technology. Additionally, the goals focus on the nature of science, its processes, historical and contemporary aspects of the development of science and science communication. While these goals are explicitly articulated, they are interdependent and collectively contribute to a better understanding of the world around us. Accordingly, the chapters of this textbook are structured around creative activities, reflective questions, processes and illustrations. The integration of the concepts from biology, chemistry, physics and earth science, and cross-cutting themes, such as value education, inclusive education, Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) and environmental education have been interwoven in the content.

Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous materials are those that do not have a shiny surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc.", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}

We want to find out more about the world we live in and worlds beyond. By now, you have perhaps read a little bit about the world of plants and animals, done some fun activities, learnt about how we measure, wondered about the stars that shine in the night sky, and so on. But remember, this is just the beginning. Science is a never-ending adventure, with new discoveries coming up all the time. And as you progress through the Middle Stage, the things you come across will help you find out even more about the world around you. The key lies in that curiosity you have nurtured throughout this journey. Keep observing the world around you, keep asking questions, and do not be afraid to experiment. Remember, even the most groundbreaking discoveries often begin with a simple “Why?”. There are countless questions waiting to be answered, and countless answers waiting to be questioned. You, my young scientist, can find them out. So, go forth and explore! And see you again in the next Grade for more adventures in science!", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}
