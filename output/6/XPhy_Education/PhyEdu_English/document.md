The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavours and knowledge, while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF- SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pafichakoshas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts asa bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a

judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practicing teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks.

Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education, a new subject area called ‘Physical Education and Well-being’ has been introduced at the Middle Stage. This subject aims to promote love for physical activity and sports; develop capacities for skillful engagement in sports; and develop resilience, empathy, and cooperation. India has a wonderful tradition of Yoga which is a wholesome experience for maintaining mind and body wellbeing. The subject of Physical Education and Well-being includes various aspects of Yoga starting from Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama and Dhyana in a progressive way from Class 3 till the Secondary Stage. This lays the foundation for holistic health and well-being.

The book for Physical Education and Well-being, titled Khel Yatra for Grade 6, is meticulously designed to develop motor skills and engage children in the team sports of Kho-kho and Hand ball. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage.

Khel Yatra emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness.

The content and activities are designed to encourage peer group learning, and enrich the educational experience for both students and teachers. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore interesting local games and play with friends. This book is not only useful for school learning, but also a valuable resource for parents and community.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. Schoollibraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 (NCF-SE 2023) recognises the criticality of the health and well- being of individuals as a key factor for success in all aspects of life. Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for

all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 6. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities.

To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 6 textbook is designed to have five units.

1. Understanding the importance of Physical education

2. Motor fitness

3. Introduction to Kho-Kho

4. Introduction to Handball

5. Yoga

In Unit 1, students explore the connection between physical education

(PE) and well-being, emphasizing its impact on personal and social behaviour. Through playing games and engaging in discussions,

## viii

students will understand the importance of living a healthy lifestyle and how physical activity adds to their overall enjoyment and success. Students will also learn about the safety measures to minimize the risk of injuries and create a healthy environment for the players.

In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health.

In the Units 3 and 4 focus is on learning new games. Kho Kho is introduced in Unit 3 and Handball in Unit 4. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sport and health advantages of physical activity. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement.

In the last unit, students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogasanas starting with Sukshma Vyayama (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each asana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Pranayama strengthen the lungs, improves functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dharana (single pointed concentration) and Dhyana (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays foundation for long and healthy life.

In this book, apart from learning the games and physical activities, students will learn to follow rules, understand the importance of safe practices and fair play, work harmoniously in groups, treat each other with courtesy and respect, as well as, help each other, and experience the joy of playing together. Inculcation of these values and dispositions will partly happen while children are engaged in

the physical activities or games and partly, they will be reinforced during circle time after the game. Sufficient time must be given for circle time during the Physical Education and Well-being periods.


## Structure and Flow of Classes

NCF-SE 2023 has recommended 120 periods for physical education and well-being in Grade 6. Suggestive timetable assumes at least 5 periods of 40 minute each, per week. NCF-SE recommends allocating block period (2 periods together) for physical education and well- being. If it is not possible to allocate two block periods and one single period every week, it is necessary to design single periods with different focus to ensure sufficient time for activities, game and circle time.

Suggestions are given below for two different scenarios of timetable.


## e Scenario 1 — Five single periods per week.

¢ Scenario 2 - Two block periods for Units 1 to 4 and single period for yoga.

Scenario 1: Three different types of sessions have been visualised to effectively use the limited time in each period and achieve the learning outcomes.


## ¢ Type 1: Maximizes game practice.

° Type 2: Maximizes circle time after play to provide sufficient time for discussing cognitive and socio-emotional aspects.

¢ Type 3: Maximizes gamified drills to focus on one specific skill.

A sample time allocation for a 40-minute duration is given below for all types.

## For joyful experience, safety of children and effective development

of competencies, teachers may follow the instructions given below:

Ensure adequate play area and there are no obstructions in the play area.

For group activities, mark the area into smaller blocks to prevent students from running into each other.

While dividing the teams make sure that the teams are fair and balanced in terms of bodyweight, height and skills required for the activity.

Ensure that a first aid kit is available and accessible.

Ensure that students are treated with respect and they feel emotionally and socially safe.

Provide regular encouragement and support to all the students. Ensure students have access to fair redressal of grievances during the Physical Education period.

Encourage students to be aware of their surroundings while playing.

Instruct the students not to aim at the opponent, unless told otherwise, and discuss why this is important.

Encourage the students to be careful while pushing or pulling the opponent in the activity.

Ensure that students do proper warm-up and cool-down. Encourage them to create their own routines.


## Provide opportunities to students for interactions before, during and after the class.

Introduced sports skills gradually. Complexity can be increased by playing mini versions of the sport gradually building individual capacities such as observation, reflection, emotional regulation, expanding spatial awareness and peripheral vision, and making quick judgements based on gameplay.

Discuss social capacities such as effective communication, collective decision making, and working together towards a common goal, during circle time and at relevant moments in the sport.

Encourage students to take more responsibility for building a

culture of inclusive sports at school. Help them to take an active

role in ensuring all students feel safe, motivated, and encouraged to play.

## Importance of Physical Education and Well-being 13

In this unit, we will learn about the importance of fitness. We will also understand that being fit can help us to be healthy and strong. Here are a few things we can do to be fit:

1. Endurance: We will do fun activities that will help us to play longer without getting tired.

2. Building strength: We will get stronger with regular exercise. It will build our muscles and bones.

3. Becoming flexible: When we stretch and move in guided ways, our bodies will become flexible.

4. Learning balance: When we practice being steady while playing and exercising, we also learn to balance our body.

Let’s get moving and explore fitness with fun!

## Introductionito Moto Fitness


## Motor Fitness refers to the ability of our body’s muscles

and nerves to work together effectively and efficiently. It involves skills like coordination, balance, agility, and reaction time. Good motor fitness helps us to perform daily tasks

and activities easily and with control. But before we do any activity, we need to understand the concepts and techniques of warm-up, cool-down and stretching. Let us start our journey of fitness with the right first step!

Why is warm-up important?

Warming up prepares the body for an activity, by raising the body temperature and heart

rate which improves physical efficiency and performance. Warming up, stretching muscles and moving joints prior to an activity minimises the risk of injury.

## Motor Fitness 15

How to warm-up?

For approximately 5-10 minutes engage

in any progressively light to intense grade exercise related to the sporting activity can be performed. For example, football kick, rugby ball passing, lifting light weights, shadow boxing, etc., followed by general exercises such as jogging, shuttle runs, high knee sprints can be perfomed. Once you start feeling energised, stretching exercises must be performed prior to commencing the sport or activity.

Why Should we stretch? --:--:: cee nes

Stretching exercises are recommended before and after participating in any sport as they prepare the body for the forthcoming physical activity by enabling joints to move through their full range of motion. Pre-stretching reduces the risk of injury and post-stretching helps in recovery.

Keep your body relaxed. During stretching, concentrate on taking slow and deep breaths. Flexibility improves when the mind and muscles are relaxed. Everyone’s ability to move and flexibility varies as they depend on physical characteristics, fitness levels and age. Always remember to stretch within your limitations and do not try to compete.

CONCEPT e The 3-2-3 chain in Kho-Kho involves a specific defense strategy where players form a chain with three chasers in the front, two in the middle and three at the back. This formation is used to create a strong defense barrier.


## POSITIONING

e Ensure that you have understood your designated position in the 3-2-3 chain. Positions are typically assigned based on the order in which players are lined up at the start of the match. Each player in the chain has a specific role to play in maintaining the barrier.

LEAD-UP ACTIVITY . Standing Kho-Kho: Form a circle. Form six groups and stand at the circle’s border. One of you will be the chaser, while the other will be the runner. ‘Chaser’ can enter the circle, but the runner cannot. When the runner wishes to pass, then only entry is allowed in the circle and then the runner can stand in front of the lane. The runner will join the lane in which the last person will become the runner. If the chaser catches the runner, the runner turns into the chaser and vice versa.

## TARGET

¢ The player will deliver the pass to a teammate aiming for their torso.


## Fundamental Skills of Handball 17


## Khel Yatra


## EXECUTION

¢ The throwing arm is brought back behind the head with elbow bent at an angle of 90 degrees. That means the ball is placed slightly behind and above the player’s head.

¢ Inan effortless action, the player stretches his throwing arm upward and forward before releasing the ball at the highest point. The wrist snaps forward upon release, adding accuracy to the pass.


## FOLLOW-THROUGH

e After releasing the ball, the throwing arm moves in forward and downward position with the hand pointing in the direction of the desired target. This follow-through helps to keep the pass accurate and powerful.


## LEAD-UP ACTIVITY

Monkey in the Middle: Form a Circle. One ‘monkey’ (player) will be inside the circle. The other players aim to pass the handball to each other while the monkey in the middle will try to intercept or touch the ball. If the monkey disrupts a pass, the player who made the unsuccessful pass becomes the new monkey.

Variation: Monkeys can be two or three in number.

Divide the players into two teams. The number of players per team depends on the overall number of players available. Define a play

area that will be appropriate for the number of players.

It might be a half-court or a smaller area of the handball court to increase the difficulty level. The team with the ball begins the game and must aim to complete ten consecutive passes. The players are encouraged to move continuously, looking for open spaces and establishing passing lanes. The opposing team plays for the defence, attempting to intercept the ball. If the ball is intercepted or dropped, possession of the ball shifts to the defence team. The new defence squad then attempts to complete their own 10-pass series.


## Fundamental Skills of Handball 83


## LEAD-UP ACTIVITY

Pass and Chase: Two groups will line up on opposite sides and run parallel to each other in the same direction. Make sure that the groups are at least 5 metres apart from each other. One player will hold the ball, while the others will be empty-handed. The player with the ball will try to pass it to the other group player while the other players are running. The player from the receiving group who catches the ball joins back

the throwing team’s queue. Also the player who threw the ball joins the receiving team’s queue. The game continues with both groups running and passing the ball back and forth.

Players 1 and 3 will have one ball each and will start the game at the same time. On the sound of the whistle, Player 1 will dribble the ball twice and throw it towards the Player 2, and then run and take the place of Player 2. Similarly, Player 3 will dribble twice and throw the ball towards the Player 4. This will create a relay and two players will try to stop this relay by blocking the ball. Whoever succeeds in obstructing the ball will exchange the role with the player and relay continues.

## Chapter 1


## Yoga for Daily Life

As students, you have busy schedules filled with classes, activities, projects and homework. Yoga can help you manage these activities by keeping your mind clear and focused. It can also improve physical health, making it easier to participate in sports and other activities. By incorporating Yoga into your daily routine, you will find it easier to stay calm and energised throughout the day.

Yoga helps you to focus and be more aware of your thoughts and feelings. It helps you get stronger and more flexible. It can improve your concentration, so you might find it easier to pay attention in class or while doing homework. Yoga can help you relax by helping you let go of your worries, especially if you are feeling stressed about school or other things. Overall, doing Yoga can make you feel happier and more at ease. Even a few minutes of Yoga each day can make a big difference. It’s a great way to take care of your body and mind.


## History of Yoga

Yoga's roots can be traced back to the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of India. During this time, people practised Yoga to connect with nature and the divine. Each chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, part of the epic Mahabharata, is named after different types of Yoga, including Karma Yoga (Yoga of action), Bhakti Yoga (Yoga of devotion), Jnana Yoga (Yoga of wisdom) and Raja Yoga (Yoga of willpower).


## LOT nti

_ Ag orgs nas Yoga 113

More than 2,000 years ago, Maharsi Patanjali compiled the practices of Yoga in 196 Yoga Sutras. These sutras describe a step-by-step path to achieve the highest state of bliss (Samadhi) through systematic practices defined as the eight limbs or aspects, called Ashtanga Yoga. We will learn more about Ashtanga Yoga later in this chapter.

Yoga continued to evolve with new practices and ideas. Hatha Yoga, which deals with the practical aspects of Yoga, was developed around 1,500 years ago.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Yoga masters like Swami Vivekananda, Paramahamsa Yogananda, Sage Aurobindo and B.K.S. Iyengar brought Yoga to the rest of the world. Today, Yoga is practised globally; the International Day of Yoga is celebrated on 21*June in more than 190 countries.


## What is Yoga?

Ancient Indians had discovered that practising Yoga, can lead one to good health and well-being. Yoga can be defined as the science of healthy and happy living. It helps us to be peaceful and efficient in our work, study and other activities and move towards the full realisation of our potential.

The term Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit word “yuj” which means “to unite or integrate”. It signifies the union of the body, mind and inner self. Yoga is about bringing different parts of yourself to create balance, harmony and a sense of oneness — both within and with the world around you. It also helps make the mind still, quiet and free from all distractions.

Yoga involves systematic efforts, not haphazard actions. Efforts become fruitful only through disciplined actions.

Let’s explore the eight aspects of Ashtanga Yoga, which consists of the systematic processes formulated by Maharsi Patanjali.

These eight aspects are explained below:

1. Yama (Social Discipline)

8. Samadhi 2. Niyama (Blissful Experience) | — _\ (Personal Discipline) 7. Dhyana 3. Asana (Contemplation) (Posture) 6. Dharana 4, Pranayama (Concentration) (Mastery over Breath)

5. Pratyahara (Mastery over Senses)

1. Yama (Social Discipline and Ethics): These are guidelines about how to behave towards others, such as being kind and honest.

2. Niyama (Personal Discipline): These are guidelines about how to take care of yourself, like keeping clean and being content.

Yoga is a lifelong journey. We have to practice it every day.

Let us start our journey with the first two steps - Yama and Niyama.


## YAMA

There are five important guidelines for living happily with others according to Ashtanga Yoga; these social disciplines are called Yama. Yama forms the first limb of Ashtanga Yoga. Let’s find out more about these five Yamas.

1. Ahimsa means being kind and not hurting any living being, including plants and animals.

Satya refers to always telling the truth and being honest. Asteya teaches you to not take things that do not belong to you.

## Aparigraha

Aparigraha is about letting go of wanting more and more and being grateful for what you already have. It helps you to live a simple life and to be generous with others.

Let us learn about Aparigraha through an inspiring story of Lal Bahadur Shastri, who served as the second prime minister

Children will experience the joy of giving and practice of letting go of possessions.


## NIYAMA

The second aspect of Ashtanga Yoga is Niyama, which consists of five important guidelines or habits for personal discipline.

Let us find out more about these five Niyamas.

ss Ae pea and consistent effort is called Tapas.


## 120 Khel Yatra

19-Jul-24 3:33:55 PM

It’s like training for a sports event, practising an instrument, or helping with chores at home — doing things regularly, even when you don’t feel like it. Tapas teaches that hard work and dedication can help us to achieve our goals and improve ourselves. By practising Tapas, we learn the importance of commitment and how small consistent actions can lead to big results.


## Tapas in our life:

Dedication towards studies, self-discipline, regular exercise for good health, always eating nutritious food, keeping things clean, always speaking the truth, daily practice of Yoga, etc.

We see many great people around us, their success is inspiring us to set high goals in our lives. Have you heard about the Tapas of these great people? Let us read the inspiring story of Malli Mastan Babu-India’s mountain man to understand the power of Tapas.


## Malli Mastan Babu’s Determination

Malli Mastan Babu was born ina small village in Andhra Pradesh and his father was a farmer. A bright student and eager to learn about new things, Babu studied very hard and went to some of the best schools in India. He got degrees in engineering and management.

During the course of his studies, Babu developed a keen interest in mountaineering. Inspired by the challenge and beauty of the mountains, he decided to pursue this passion alongside his professional career. He trained hard, learning everything about climbing. He practiced yoga to build physical strength, flexibility and stay mentally focused, all of which helped in his challenging climbs. His dedication to physical fitness, including yoga, was a significant part of his success in achieving numerous expeditions.

His approach to mountaineering was driven by an unwavering passion and dedication. He believed in pushing his limits and embraced the challenges that came with high-altitude climbing. Through his climbs, he aimed to inspire others to follow their dreams and overcome obstacles, no matter how difficult they might seem.

Babu, whenever on expedition, would plan every last detail. He would start early in the day, carry his own load and walk at a steady clip throughout the day. During his expedition he used to pitch his own tent, cook his own food and fine-tune the next day’s plan with his guide.

Babu’s record-breaking achievement was that he completed climbing seven highest peaks in seven continents in 172 days. With this, Babu set a new benchmark of physical and mental endurance and excellence. He became the first Indian and South Asian to achieve this record, earning him international recognition and admiration.

Even though he is no longer with us, his story is one of extraordinary courage, determination and passion. His life reminds us to dream big, work hard and always do our best. He remains an enduring inspiration to those who dare to push their boundaries and reach for the skies.


## ACTIVITY

Narrate a story of your role model in the class. * Discuss the common themes in all the stories told. ¢ Think and discuss why it is important to have goal in life.

Write about a time when they worked hard to achieve something. What did they learn from the experience and how did they feel after achieving the goal?


## Note for the Teacher

¢ Discuss with the students how great achievers like scientists, administrators, national awardees, athletes, etc., could reach their goals with determination and consistent effort.

## ACTIVITY

1. Setting Goals: Each student writes down one goal they want to achieve, such as reading for 20 minutes every day, practising a sport, or helping with chores.

Plan: Write down the steps to achieve this goal. Tracking Progress: Make a simple chart to track daily progress.

Reflection: At the end of the week, discuss what you have learned about self-discipline and how it felt to work towards achieving the goal.


## PRATYAHARA

Pratyahara, the fifth aspect of Ashtanga Yoga, is all about learning to control your senses and focus your mind.

Imagine you are in a noisy room, but you need to concentrate on your homework. Pratyadhara means to restrain or to withdraw, not to get disturbed by things that one sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels.

Pratyahara helps you ignore the noise and focus on what you're doing by tuning out distractions.

By practising this you learn to turn your attention inward, away from the things around you and become more aware of your thoughts and feelings.

We sense the world around us through five senses; to focus on the desired activity and avoid distractions, we need to master these senses by practices.

Let’s look at some activities which will help us in turning senses inwards.

1. Quiet time: Find a comfortable place to sit quietly without any distractions (no TV, mobile phone, or loud noises). Close

your eyes and focus on your breathing. Fee FS


## Yoga 123

2. Mindful eating: Turn off the TV and put away gadgets during meals. Focus on the taste, texture and smell of the food. Chew slowly and enjoy each bite.

3. Tune with nature: Go for a walkin a parkor garden. Observe the sights, sounds and smells around you without getting lost in thoughts or using electronic devices.

4. Listening to music: Choose some soothing music, sit quietly and listen to the sounds without doing anything else.

5. Before going to bed: Spend a few minutes sitting quietly. Close your eyes gently and focus on your breath. Avoid using electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bedtime, instead try to read a book.

These activities willhelp you to enhance your ability to focus, reduce stress and connect more deeply with yourselves and your surroundings.

Food plays a very important role in the development of our personality. Further, we should consume healthy food according to the season and in moderate quantity. So, it is necessary to develop healthy food habits as per Ayurveda (ancient Indian medical science).

## Preparing for Yogic Practices

Namaste Young Yogis! Are you ready to embark on a journey with the Yogic practices?

In the previous chapter, you learnt about Yama and Niyama. Here let us explore Asanas, Pranayama, Pratyadhara. Dharana and Dhyana. We will also learn about some other aspects of Yoga, like Krida Yoga in the following chapters, starting with preparatory practices.

Learn these practices under the guidance of your teacher in the school and master them by performing daily at home. Regular practice (sadhana) makes us strong, flexible and calm. It helps us feel peaceful and concentrate better on our homework, during play and in everything we do.

So, let’s roll out our Yoga mats, take a deep breath and start this amazing adventure together!

Remember, Yoga is about feeling good; it is important to pay attention to how your body feels during the practice. Never push yourself into a pose that causes pain or discomfort. Before we start Asanas and Prdndydma, it is important to prepare ourselves by doing breathing practices, loosening the joints (Sakshma Vyayama) and flexing the spine (Sithalikarana Vyayama).

General guidelines to be followed before practising all yogic


## practices.

1. Do not force yourself to breathe deeply or to hold your breath while doing the Asanas. Breathe normally while doing the Asanas. Always breathe through the nose.

2. Always be alert, attentive and watchful when you practice. Concentrate on your pose. Watch your teachers carefully and pay attention to their instructions.

3. Do not wear shoes or socks while doing the Asanas.

4. Whenever you are feeling ill or sick, you must rest. If you have a cold, cough, headache, stomach ache, sprained ankle etc., consult your teacher and seek their guidance.

5. Especially for girls, when you have your menstrual period, inform or consult your teacher before the practice.


## Breathing Practices

Before learning Pranayama, it is necessary to improve the function of the lungs. For healthy lungs, it is necessary to practice proper breathing.

Let us learn about Rabbit and Dog breathing. Rabbit breathing focuses on deep, rhythmic breaths that mimic the breathing pattern of a rabbit. Dog breathing involves mimicking the rapid, shallow breathing of a dog, which can help to release heat from the body and improve breath control.

Breathing practices enhance lung capacity, improve respiratory efficiency, promote relaxation and reduce stress.

## SUKSHMA VYAYAMA

Sukshma Vydyama is a series of subtle exercises designed to loosen (release tension) the joints and improve flexibility. The term “Sukshma Vyayama” comes from Sanskrit, where “Sukshma” means “subtle” or “micro” and “Vyadyama” means “exercise” or “movement”. These exercises are gentle, easy to perform and can be practised by people of all ages and fitness levels.

The exercises involve small, subtle movements that focus on different parts of the body. These movements help to increase circulation, improve joint mobility and release muscular tension. The subtle movements enhance blood flow to various parts of the body, promoting better circulation and oxygenation of tissues.

Each movement is synchronised with the breath, enhancing the flow of Prana (vital energy) throughout the body.

The simplicity of Sukshma Vyayama makes it accessible to everyone, including the elderly, those with limited mobility or beginners new to Yoga. These exercises can be performed while sitting or standing.

Sukshma Vyayama includes neck exercises, shoulder rotations, finger and wrist movements knee movements, ankle and foot exercises, etc.

Asana, the third limb of Ashtanga Yoga, are specialised postures of the body, which help our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease-free. Maharsi Patanjali defines Asana as “Sthirm Sukham Asanam” which, meaning to be “able to be in a comfortable position for extended periods.” When Asanas are combined with breath awareness, they cultivate a deeper connection between the body and mind. They also remove physical discomfort and prepare individuals for meditation.

There are several benefits of practising Asanas every day, some of which are listed below:

19-Jul-24 3:34:16 PM

One of the most essential signs of life is breath. It has to function continuously for us to be alive. The quality of breath has a profound impact on the quality of our lives. In Yoga, breath is called manifestation of ‘Prana’ (life force) and ‘Ayama’ is control and expansion of this life force —- breath. There are three important practices in Pranayama.

1. Inhalation of breath (Puraka)

2. Exhalation of breath (Rechaka)

3. Retention of breath (Kumbhaka)

There are several Pranayama techniques (breathing practices) to strengthen the life force. It impacts the smooth functioning of major systems of our body (digestive, circulatory, respiratory, excretory and nervous systems), calm down the mind, improve concentration and helps in achieving overall harmony and well-being.

Pranayama starts with breathing practices to develop healthy habits of deep and rhythmic breathing and being aware of the breath. Pranayama stimulates, calms down and balances the energy channels promoting calmness and clarity.

Techniques like Bhramarit soothe the nervous system and reduce anxiety. There are several other techniques to increase the oxygen supply, energise the body and exercise the lungs. Now, we will learn about:

1. Sectional Breathing

2. Nadisuddhi Pranayama

3. Bhramari Pranayama

Perform these techniques under the guidance of the teacher and follow the instructions given below.


## Guidelines for the practice of Pranayama:

1. Breathing in Pranayama should be done through the nose only.

2. The face, shoulder and other parts of the body should be relaxed while practising Pranayama.

3. Keep the eyes closed, neck and head straight and spine erect.

4. Observe the abdominal movement during the Pranayama practice.

5. Repeat each practice five times to understand it fully and then practice it daily to slowly gain mastery.


## Sectional Breathing

Sectional breathing is a Pranayama technique— that involves consciously directing the breath to specific sections of the lungs to enhance respiratory capacity and awareness. This technique helps practitioners become more aware of their breathing, which improves lung efficiency by fully utilising different parts of the lungs. It also ensures better oxygenation of blood and reduces anxiety through deep mindful breathing.

Let us learn sectional breathing in the following three sections: ¢ Abdominal or diaphragmatic breathing ¢ Thoracic (chest) or intercostal breathing ¢ Clavicular (upper chest) or upper lobar breathing

Sit in Vajrdsana, Virdsana, Padmasana, or Sukhasana with spine erect, face relaxed and eyes gently closed.


## Abdominal or Diaphragmatic Breathing - Adhama Svasa

1. Adopt Cin Mudra and keep your hands on your thighs.

2. Inhale completely so that the abdomen bulges out and the diaphragm is pushed down.

3. Exhale slowly and completely so that the abdomen is drawn inwards and the diaphragm returns to its normal state.

4. The inhalation and exhalation should be slow, deep, smooth, relaxed and rhythmic.

5. There should be no jerks in the whole process. 6. Repeat the practice for five rounds.


## Thoracic or (Chest) Intercostal Breathing -— Madhyama Svasa

1. Adopt Cinmaya Mudra and keep your hands on your thighs.

2. Inhale deeply while expanding the chest. 3. Exhale completely while contracting the chest.

During thoracic breathing, air flows through both the nostrils slowly and continuously and the middle lobes of the lungs open up.

5. Repeat the practice for five rounds.


## Clavicular (Upper Chest) or Upper Lobar Breathing — Adhya Svasa

1. Adopt Adi Mudra and keep your hands on your thighs. 2. Inhale deeply while raising the collar bones.

3. Exhale slowly while bringing back the collar bones to normal position.

4. Repeat the practice for five rounds.


## Physical Education Unit 5.indd 159


## Full Yogic Breathing — Purna Svasa

1. Adopt Brahma Mudra as shown in the picture and place it below the navel region

2. Inhale deeply while bulging the abdomen, expanding the chest and raising the collar bones.

3. Exhale slowly while sinking the abdomen, contracting the chest and bringing back the collar bones.


## Alternate Nostril Breathing — Nadisuddhi Pranayama or Pranayama

Nadiguddhi Pranayama is a simple and powerful technique that balances the flow of Prana (life force) and cleans the subtle energy channels. Nadi means energy channels and Suddhi means cleaning. The balanced and rhythmic breathing patterns calm down the mind, reduce anxiety and promote emotional stability.

A few points are important for the practice of Nadtsuddhi Pranayama:

1. Practice this Pranayama daily for long-term benefits. 2. Be aware of the breath while practising.

3. Let the breath flow naturally.

4. Avoid jerks or strain during the practice.

Note for the Teacher « Encourage the students to co-ordinate the movement with the breathing. ¢ Ensure students perform sectional breathing smoothly.

## Bhramari Pranayama

The Bhramart Pranayama technique mimics the humming sound of a female bee. The name “Bhramart” comes from the Sanskrit word “Bhramari,” which means female bee. Bhramari Pranayama is a calming technique, which has a soothing effect on the mind and nervous system. It involves inhaling deeply and producing a low humming sound during exhalation.

Bhramari Pranayama has several benefits: Reduces stress and anxiety. Improves concentration and memory.

## ¢ Repeat the practice five times.


## Note for the Teacher

¢ Ask the students whether they could feel the resonance during the practice. Ask about their state of mind after the practice.

## Pratyahara

In today’s fast-moving world, Pratyahara assumes a very important role. As all our sense organs are turned outward they respond to speed, it is necessary to learn the art of slowing down or different ways of sublimation or willful withdrawal of our senses.

The Yogic practice of Pratyahara helps to increase happiness by exercising moderation in food, entertainment, sleep and in all our activities. By practising Pratyahara one can avoid distraction caused by our senses. By doing this one can process the inward journey.

In the previous chapters, we have learnt various ways of managing the senses through Pratyahara activities.


## Chapter 5


## Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi

In this chapter, let us first learn about how to focus before doing Dhyana.

Have you ever sat down calmly with your eyes closed?

When our eyes are open, we see the world outside and when our eyes are closed, we can experience the world within us.

Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi are three limbs of Ashtanga Yoga, which deal with focusing and calming the mind to experience peace and joy.

The first step towards experiencing the peace within is to focus our wandering mind on some object, it can be observing the breath or flame of the candle or the tip of the thumb from the stretched hand. This single-point concentration is called Dharana. Dharana involves keeping the mind steady and maintaining concentration.

Let us learn the art of focusing by practising Jatru Trataka using the shoulders and the thumbs.


## Jatru Trataka

Jatru Trataka is a Yogic gazing that helps to bring one pointed concentration or focus. It is a practice where the gaze is fixed on an object or the target.

## Up and Down Viewing

Step 1: Sit in Vajrdsana or Sukhasana comfortably. Keep your eyes open and hands on the thigh.

Step 2: Lift the right hand to the shoulder level in front, and make a fist with the thumb turned sideward.

Step 3: Focus eyes on the tip of the thumb and slowly start moving the right hand up.

Step 4: Both the eyes must be constantly focused on the tip of the thumb while the hand keeps moving up and down. Do not move the head, but move only the eyeballs up and down. Repeat this practice for three to five rounds.

Step 5: After the practice do simple palming and relax in Vajrdsana or Sukhasana .


## Repeat the same practice on the left side.

## Step 5:

Sit in Vajrasana or Sukhdasana comfortably. Keep your eyes open and hands on the thighs.

Stretch the right hand in front, and make a fist out of it with the thumb raised upwards.

Move the right hand towards the right shoulder parallel to the ground and keep gazing at the tip of the thumb. Maintain this position for a while by holding the hand at the right end. Slowly move the right hand back to the original position while gazing at the tip of the thumb. Do not move the head but move only the eyeballs sideways.

After the practice do simple palming and relax in Vajrdsana or Sukhasana.

Simple palming procedure: 1. Rub both palms until they become warm.

2. Cup your palms and place them gently over the eyes (do not put pressure on the eyeballs).

3. Keep the eyes closed.

Keep your palms on your eyes for 10-15 seconds, then gently lift them.

1. Jatru Trataka improves concentration, intelligence and memory.

2. It also improves eyesight and vision. 3. It enhances self-confidence, patience and willpower.

: Limitations: Students with severe headache should avoid the practice.

Note for the Teacher « Ensure that students remove their glasses and wrist watches.

Encourage them to sit with the head, neck and spine erect during the practice. Always open the eyes with a few blinks.

« Ensure palming is done after each practice.

## DHYANA

Dhyana means meditation, contemplation or reflection of the higher self or God. When concentration becomes uninterrupted and flows continuously like a stream, it transforms into Dhyana. In Dhyana, there is a continuous flow of attention towards the chosen focus without distraction. Unlike Dharana where effort is required to maintain concentration, Dhyana is characterised by a state of effortless presence and immersion in the object of meditation.

Practising Dhyana leads to a profound sense of inner stillness and tranquility. Regular practice of Dhyana enhances mental clarity, sharpens focus, reduces anxiety and improves cognitive function.

Dhyana can be practiced in many ways. In this grade, we will learn about Nadanusandhana (meditating on sound).


## Guidelines for the practice of Dhyana

1. Findacalm and clean place. Sit in Padmasana or Sukhasana with the spine erect and the body relaxed.

2. Select the object of focus, such as a breath or a mantra or some visual object and focus your attention on it. Keep your eyes closed during the practice.

3. Remain non-reactive to the thoughts or emotions that come up during the practice.

4. In the beginning it is generally difficult to observe the breath for a long time. If your mind wanders, slowly but firmly bring your attention back to your breath.

5. Consistency is important; practice dhyana daily, starting with a few minutes and gradually increasing the duration.


## Naddanusandhana (Sound meditation)

The term “Ndda” means sound and “Anusandhdna” means


## investigation or exploration. Therefore, Nddanusandhana

involves the exploration and deep meditation on sound

vibrations. Different sounds like A, U, M and AUM are chanted

slowly so that they generate a fine resonance all over the body.

¢ Sit in Vajrasana or Sukhasana with the spine erect, face relaxed and eyes gently closed.

e Adopt Cin Mudra in both hands and place it on the thighs.

¢ Chant Akara for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the lower body (abdominal).

e Chant Ukara for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the middle (chest region) part of the body.

¢ Chant Mkara for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the upper (head region) part of the body.

¢ Chant Omkara for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the body.

¢ Repeat the Nadanusandhana several times a day. It helps in the expansion of awareness.


## SAMADHI

Samadhi is the highest state of consciousness. This is possible to achieve during meditation. In Samadhi, the mind is focused perfectly on the higher self or God for a long time.


## Chapter 6


## Krida Yoga

Various games are designed to understand concepts of Yoga playfully. In Sanskrit, Krida means ‘play’ or ‘sports’; hence, Krida Yoga means learning Yoga through play. Krida Yoga helps in developing some of the principles of Yoga such as joy, being mindful, concentration, strengthening breathing, creativity and love. Krida Yoga helps reduce stress and anxiety, promoting mental well-being and emotional balance.

By making Yoga enjoyable and interactive, Krida Yoga helps foster a lifelong interest in the practice and supports holistic development.

A few games are given below, you may design new games based on various principles of Yoga and play with your friends in the class or with members of your family.


## Padartha Grahi - Mindful Eating

Mindful eating is an indoor game, normally played in groups. This game can be used as an “icebreaker”, a game played to reduce inhibitions and to bring out the best in the students. In this game, food is used as a theme to encourage students to develop healthy eating habits. This game brings out creativity, awareness and emotional culture.

How to play

1. Students are instructed to keep their left hand near their chest to resemble a plate.

172 Khel Yatra irae tome

2. The teacher calls out names of different edibles and takes over edible things rapidly.

For example, Names of vegetables: carrot, pumpkin, paper, beetroot, bat, cabbage, pencil, drumsticks, beans, radish, eraser, potato. Names of fruits: apples, mango, chiku, chair, grapes, orange, desk, banana, grapes, pineapple, duster, papaya, watermelon.

3. Whenever the teacher names a healthy food item, the students should mime eating from the plate with their right hands and say, “We eat”.

For example, if the teacher says “Carrot”, the students should do the eating action and say, “We eat”.

4. The teacher can mix different non-edible items like mud, stone, etc. or junk food in between. For non-edible and junk food items, the students should remain silent.

5. The students who do the action or say, “We eat”, for non- edible or junk food items are considered out.

6. Those who remain till the end are declared winners.


## Note for the Teacher

¢ The teacher can take up the names of healthy food (“We eat”) and junk food (silent). Food items like rice, dosa, dal, chapati, idly, upma, etc., can also be used.


## Paficabhita

Paficabhita is a group game, through which children learn the names of five elements or Paficabhittas as shown in the below picture. This game focuses on awareness, attention, listening comprehension and coordination between the body and the mind. Initially, the teacher has to perform the actions along with the students to understand the instructions of the game.


## How TO PLAY

1. The students should stand in a circle with the teacher in the centre.

2. When the teacher names a paficabhita element students should act as that element as given in the following table.

3. The speed of these motions can be increased gradually and the order of the Paficabhutas can be mixed.

4. The students who do it wrong are out. The student who remains till the end wins the game.

Note for the Teacher * Variations are encouraged to make the game interesting. ¢ Ensure all students participate in the game.
