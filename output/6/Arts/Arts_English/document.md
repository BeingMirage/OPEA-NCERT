The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages an education system that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while simultaneously preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities (touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the panchkoshas), in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages it has paved the way for the progression of their learning, further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade VI to Grade VIII.

At the Middle Stage, the NCF-SE 2023 aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects, namely three languages—out of which at least two languages native to India, Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education, Yoga and Well-being, and Vocational Education will promote their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate and interactive textbooks in different curricular areas which will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—arole that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions — classroom arrangement, technology integration and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is

iv committed for providing students with such high-quality textbooks. The various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, artists and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Kriti-I, the textbook of Arts for Grade VI is one of these.

The contents of Kriti-I encompass the art forms of Visual Arts, Dance, Theatre and Music. This textbook is for the learners to explore their creativity as well as express and explore themselves. Kriti-I has infused in its contents, visuals and other components, the rich Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, values — all deeply rooted in Bharat. Inclusivity of all genders and students with special abilities is inherent to arts giving equal opportunity to all students. Making optimum use of the technology integration, QR codes have been embedded throughout, as additional learning resources.

For all practical purposes, Kriti-I has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals —to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of theme and content, and develop among them the core competencies at this stage as envisaged in the NCF-SE for creativity, exploration and experiences of different art forms. The sections and chapters are intelligently designed to accommodate all students in various activities, bringing out their creativity and expression. Each activity suggested here will take the students to a journey to discover more such learning resources, be it their natural surroundings, day-to-day chores or human interventions. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

kriti-I is the textbook which will take you to the world of art, exploring and discovering the vast, and exciting universe of visual and performing arts, aiming to ignite creativity, enhance appreciation for different art forms, and develop the artistic skills of students. Designed for Grade VI, this book has a variety of artistic disciplines, included in visual arts, music, dance and theatre.

Based on the spirit of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and on curricular goals, competencies and learning outcomes laid out in the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 for Arts Education, Kriti-I is a book for creation in different art forms. It has numerous engaging hands-on activities and inspiring projects that will help in understanding and appreciating the role of art in life and the world around us. Students will also learn about famous artists and their works, explore different techniques and styles, and even create on their own. Each of the activity will give a unique experience to the learners!

Apart from the activities and information given in this book, there are more such activities and creative ideas given in digital form, that can be accessed by scanning the QR code in the beginning of the textbook and every chapter as well as where ever the need has been felt. The beauty of art is that it can connect to people of varied interests and tastes. Each one can find their unique connection to the arts. In our country, there has been a long history of heritage, culture and tradition where all art forms were practiced.

“The Arts are about human aesthetic sensibility. Aesthetic sensibility refers to our ability to perceive beauty, arrive at considered judgements regarding the good and beautiful, and strive towards a sense of refinement in the art-making process. Art is a personal form of understanding beauty, shape, symmetry, pattern and movement blended in expression to evoke feelings. Artistic work covers both conceptual and procedural knowledge, and deals with the ‘embodied’ sensory and emotional experiences of human beings.” (NCF-SE, page 294). Thus, the core idea behind creating this book has been to make sure learners enjoy the entire process

of exploration into the world of different art forms. The fact that it should nowhere become stressful for the child to learn or try something new has been kept in mind while developing the textbook. As each learner finds their connection to the art form in their own way, it would be fruitful if the teachers also actively participate in activities to support the learner into this journey of arts, rather than forcing information.

kKriti-I has four sections, which are represented by specific colours, throughout the book;


## YELLOW for Visual Arts


## BLUE for Music


## PINK for Dance and Movements PURPLE for Theatre

Each of the above section is uniquely designed to create an enjoyable experience.

The ‘Visual Arts’ section is designed to empower students in visualising and expressing their ideas, and emotions from everyday experiences and observations around them. The activities in this unit introduce them to fundamental skills of two-dimensional and three-dimensional techniques and explore different media and material in the Visual Arts. Across all chapters, students are introduced to a range of materials, surfaces and techniques that have been used in last hundreds of years, whereas, there are plenty of occasions where they are left to explore and discover them on their own.

The first three chapters give importance to sharpening each student’s observation through a variety of drawing exercises. Through engaging activities — techniques for making natural colours, colour mixing, and creating tints and shades are introduced. The processes involved in creating their own seals, portraits, paper crafts and flipbooks would spark many new inquiries and experiences for each student.

This unit also includes a preliminary glimpse of Indian artists and art traditions, which must be extended beyond the examples mentioned in the book. Students must explore, celebrate and study about the various art practices, traditions and artists

they find in their own region or state. The knowledge gained from such exposure would enhance their aesthetic sensibilities, creative imagination and their critical thinking skills in all the work they do.

In the section of ‘Music’ in this textbook there is a wealth to explore the knowledge, giving opportunities to the students to experience many concepts during this journey of discovery. While some elements may feel familiar and comforting, some ideas can be entirely new.

This textbook intends to fascinate everyone with the treasure of various types of music that is scattered across regions in our country, where multiple art forms are being practiced by people. Music holds a very significant place in our lives. Music is a part of all the celebrations throughout the year, whether it is national festivals, social gatherings, religious festivals or songs sung, and instruments played for dance during a ceremony, harvest or any other season. Music connects everyone in their beliefs, practices, rituals, etc., in day-to-day life.

Everyone loves singing songs and dancing to music. Apart from this textbook, in this endeavour to learn music, grandparents, parents, and community members are wonderful resources—to enhance the musical experience making it more vibrant and dynamic. The lyrics and rhythm of music, sound of instruments, physical movements, gestures accompanying the songs, the dance steps on the music played, will enhance gross and fine motor movements. The joy of music will lead students to a stress-free environment. The soul of music incorporates listening to lullabies, humming of grandmothers, farmers singing in the field, buzzing of the birds and bees or rain pattering on a window. Let us embark this journey of exploration together to find the jewels scattered all around the country in music.

The unit of ‘Dance’ has been designed to give the learner further glimpse of the varied form of dance forms of India. Furthering the knowledge of folk dance forms of India, this section will introduce the students to traditional forms like Chhau and Yakshagana. The section also gently leads them to try the basics of the classical dances and becoming familiar with some technical terms. The chapters also introduce the emotive content in performance with the Navarasa, while allowing the children to get comfortable with their emotions and express them. Hand gestures are also introduced with an idea of it being a repository for sign language. Moreover, the

viii unit focuses on the gender neutrality of dance by portraying dance forms with such features. It incorporates cross-curricular aspects and encourages them to find out more information on their own.

The ‘Theatre’ section has been structured to cover a wide range of theatrical disciplines. Each chapter aims to develop the creative skills, enhance artistic expression and deepen the appreciation for arts. Understanding and expressing emotions is not just fundamental to art forms but is also crucial in building the right emotional balance in the learner. The chapters also introduce technical elements of make-up, costume design, stage, script writing and puppetry in a practical activity-based process, that will enable each child to explore their potential and find an area of interest that they can excel in. A chapter on the traditional company theatres of India is sure to fascinate the children in the way it worked in the last few decades.

The ‘Theatre’ section is designed to provide a well-rounded approach to theatre, encouraging students to explore, create and express better. Through engaging lessons and hands-on activities, they are sure to gain valuable skills and a deeper appreciation for the diverse world of theatre.

The last chapter of Kriti-I is on the integration of all art forms with panchtatvas being the theme of the activities suggested so that students get an experience of inter-disciplinary approach within the art forms. In the end of the book, the section on assessment provides a template for recording assessment of all art forms as well as a common rubric which can be used for reporting.


## Structure of the Arts Class

It would be ideal if the classroom is free of any obstruction allowing the child to move around freely for dance, and theatre or sit down in the way they want to make a painting that they have imagined. This element of ‘freeness and openness’ in the physical environment subconsciously translates to ‘freeness and openness in thinking’. The art room should be well-equipped and visually enriching with informative display material. There will have to be a lot of interaction between the teacher and learner as well as among the peer.

## The Class Timetable

In order to keep a balanced progression of learning all the four art forms together through the academic year, five periods per week for arts may be allotted. They can either be separate periods of 40 minutes each or block periods of two 40 minutes periods combined.

You are holding ‘Kriti-I', textbook of Arts, for Grade VI, full of fun and activities. An urge for Kriti-I or creation is within you all and you have been creative in these years of your early life, now you are entering into another phase of your schooling where there is much more to explore and experiment. The book will make you more sensitive towards your surroundings, environment, people and society.

As you have experienced in the previous classes, there are so many art forms and you always enjoyed creating— doing or watching or listening or dancing, playing instruments, scribbling, drawing, painting, making models with clay, paper, and of course, singing, mimicking, drama, animation, etc. You love them in your day to day life, in school, at home or while travelling. You observe so many things around you that make you think—how people work, changes that happens with nature in different seasons, animals make sounds, birds fly, leaves rustle, flowers have so many colours and textures, bees buzz, colourful butterflies go around in the garden, daily chores are conducted in your home, trains chuck, planes fly and so forth and so on. These are the fascinating phenomenons that inspire us to create and express ourselves. They make us wonder — how, why, when and what!

The land of Bharat has witness thousands of years of human civilisation and evolution. Art is all around us and gives joy, whether we are creating or experiencing and at the same time makes lives beautiful. All of you have an artist within you, which is eager to come out and create something. To be creative, to make a work of art, make movements, you have to be a good observer, have good imagination and visualisation.

Kriti-I has four art forms full of fun and joy through which you will explore and learn these art forms—create something new daily with your friends, teachers and family.

Usually, artists recite this before starting their performances. You can also recite this loudly with action before starting every art class —

oer TH Ae, Fare ahah RATA Aangikam bhuvanam yasya, Vaachikam sarva vangmayam. Aaharyam chandra taradi Tam vande saattvikam Shivam.


## Meaning

Where the physical body is the universe,

speech or song is the essence of all sounds,

ornamentation is the Moon and the stars. I bow down to that supreme divinity.

It brings together all the four art forms you are learning — Angika: Physical performance with movement, action and expression. Vaachika: Speech, dialogue, songs and lyrics. Aahaarya: Costumes, jewellery, sculpture and painting. Saatvika: The deepest emotional spiritual experience for the artiste and audience.

This is an example of the verse written in Sanskrit by Nandikeshwara in Abhinaya Darpana around a thousand years ago. You can also refer to the videos by scanning the QR code.

## CHAPTER 1 OBJECTS AND STILL LIFE

Welcome to the first chapter where your visuals in art will narrate a story through the world of objects and still life. You will learn to add life to the still objects.


## How?

¢ By learning how to connect with


## them.


## ¢ By buildinga story around them.

¢ By observing the compositional


## arrangement.

¢ By observing how the light falls

on them creating shades and shadows.

¢ Even if they appear seperate

from one point, how do they overlap from another point of view.

Each drawing will deepen your observation and you will start depicting objects in your surroundings as you perceive them.

Each activity will sharpen your skills of shape recognition (two-dimensional). You will

## 1 Visual Arts.indd 4


## ACTIVITY 1: EXPLORE OBJECTS FROM SURROUNDINGS

Look around you and observe the various objects. What material is each object made of? Pause and think about why they are of a particular shape. Is there a reason behind their shape and form? Also, observe the space around these objects. Move around and observe the objects from different angles. After spending some time observing, select two or three objects you would like to draw.


## ACTIVITY 2: DRAW OBJECTS IN DIFFERENT WAYS

Every person draws differently. This makes their expressions unique. Here are some ideas you can try:

1. You can draw an object using one continuous line. This means, you cannot pick up your pencil from the paper while drawing the object. Ask your classmates

if they can identify the object from this drawing.

2. You can draw different parts of the object. For instance, while drawing a water bottle, draw each part (cap, container and so on) separately. Notice the difference in proportions.

3. Try and draw the same object from three different angles. Change your position or move the object around. You can place the object on the floor or even hang it. After you finish your three drawings, share them with your classmates. Which of the three angles do they find the most interesting?

## ACTIVITY 3: LIGHT AND SHADE


## Place different objects in front of you.

¢ Observe their shapes, shades, shadows and how the light falls on each of them.

¢ What is the shape of their shadows?

On which side of the objects do you see their shadow?

Use a pencil and try a few experiments. Vary the pressure as you create rhythmic strokes in any direction. Are you able to create light and dark tones?

After you have practiced this on a separate paper or drawing book, draw the objects in front of you.

Within the outline of the objects, create pencil strokes from light to medium to dark tones. Also, observe the shadows and show it in your drawing.


## | DO YOU KNOW

Amrita Sher-Gil is an important modern Indian woman artist. She was born in 1913. Her mother was from Hungary and her father was from India. She studied art in Paris. When she was 21 years old, she returned to India. She travelled around the smaller towns and villages with her

canvases, oil paints and brushes. Her paintings have rich earthy colours. She was deeply affected by observing the life and conditions of common Indian a people, and ), created paintings based on these themes.

Artists have a practice of studying objects. They arrange them in a group to create drawings, paintings, sculptures and photographs. Such artworks are called -Inastill life, a lot of thought is given to the choice of objects and how they are arranged.

Flowers, plants, vegetables, fruits, food items, clothing, tools and other household objects are also included in a still life arrangement.

Why do you think it is called a still life? If an object doesn’t have life, would it be a still life?

Still life artworks depict things that are ‘still’ and do not move. In the process of making the artwork, the objects get a new ‘life’. Look at still lifes made by well-known artists and discuss them in your class.

Try and put objects made of different materials like a bottle, fruit, metal compass, wooden ruler, piece of fabric or anything that interests you. Discuss in your group different ways the objects can be placed and arranged. The objects can touch each other or you can scatter them around. Make sure everyone in the circle can see the arrangement of objects clearly.

What are the different types of furniture you see in school and at home? Observe and draw any two or three furniture objects. Compare your drawings with the actual objects. Compare the straight lines, angles and shapes you drew with straight lines, angles and shapes in the object.

Edit your drawings so that it conveys dimension and depth around the object. This is called perspective. It gives us a feeling of three-dimensional space as though we are seeing it in front of us.

In small groups, look at your peer’s work and analyse whose work has perspective. Identify the lines, shapes and forms that are helping in showing the perspective.

How do you feel when you are surrounded by trees, plants, hills, streams, sea and sand? Spend two to three minutes imagining that you are surrounded by nature. What all do you see? How do different things feel when you touch them? What do you feel under your feet? How far can you see? Is anything moving? What do you hear?

Make small groups of four to five students and share your imaginations with one another.

Take your drawing book and a pencil, and step outdoors to explore your surroundings.

1. Look up at the sky and feel its vastness. Make a note of the colours you see or the form of the clouds.

2. Lookat the ground. Observe the colour of the soil, the different kinds of stones, pebbles and small rocks. Touch and feel their texture. Are they smooth,


## rough, bumpy, grainy or of some other texture?

3. Find a spot where there are some plants and trees. Gently touch the plant and feel the texture of its leaves, stems, barks, flowers, seed pods and anything else that you see. Try to draw those textures or note it through words.

4. Closely observe the shapes of leaves, and the lines and patterns you see. Draw three leaves which have different shapes, lines and _ patterns. Make a note of their colours.

5. Closely observe any animals, birds or insects. Are they sitting, sleeping, standing or moving? Try to draw their form.

## ACTIVITY 5: CREATING COLOUR TINTS AND SHADES

Do colours also change like our moods?

Have you observed how your moods change throughout the day? Spend five minutes recollecting your moods and talking about them: 1. What is your mood when you go home after school? 2. What is your mood at dinner time? 3. What is your mood before going to bed? 4. What is your mood when you wake up in the morning? 5. What is your mood now?

Moods and feelings last for some time and gradually change. They might feel strong and intense, or mild.

Colours are like that too. We can make them vibrant, intense, dark, pale, light, mild ... and so on.

Think of how colours change in the sky during a sunrise or sunset.


## Collage with waste fabric

Have you observed the colours of your clothes fade over time due to sunlight and repeated washing? They change from bright to dull or dark to light.

In art, these variations in colour are called tints and shades. We create colour tints by adding white to any colour. We create colour shades by adding black to any colour.

Observe how the tints or shades are enhancing the moods and emotions of the artwork. Repeat this exercise with four to five different colours, and their tints and shades. Note down a short description of the moods and emotions you have experienced with the colour tints and shades.

## ACTIVITY 6: SURFACES AND MATERIAL USED BY ARTISTS

You have learnt that colours can be made from nature. Before the invention of paper, artists used to paint on natural surfaces like rocks, walls of caves, mud plaster, palm leaves, wood and cloth.

They also used terracotta, stone, animal bone, leather, wood, metal and fibre to craft a variety of three- dimensional objects and sculptures.

They invented special tools and developed techniques for working with each material and surface.

If you did not have paper, which surfaces and materials would you choose for your artwork? Carry out your own experiments and make your artwork.

Look at the examples in the page below. You can learn about the variety of materials and surfaces that artists have used since pre-historic time.

## ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR OWN SEAL

Now that you are familiar with the features and purposes of a seal, would you like to try making your own seal?

You will first have to start with its design. Take a paper and pencil, and jot down some ideas and preparatory sketches.


## Step 1— Test with found objects


## e Prepare some clay or dough.

¢ Gather some small objects like buttons, bottle caps, sticks, leaves, coins, etc.

¢ Make your clay surface flat and damp.

¢ Press the objects you have collected on the clay and see the impressions they make.

e Analyse which objects create clearer impressions and why.

## Step 4— Test your seal

¢ Choose the material and surface for stamping your seal. If your seal is rounded and not flat, you can press it on a wet clay or dough as you did in the first test with objects.

¢ If your seal is flat, try applying paint or ink, and stamping it on any paper.

e Basedontheresult,youcanmake changes and improvements to you seal design till you achieve the desired effect.


## ACTIVITY 4: PRINTING

Now, you have a seal which can be used repeatedly! A rubber stamp pad has ink soaked in it. When we press the rubber seal into the stamp pad, it gets coated with ink which gets printed on paper by pressing. The same process can be seen across many different traditional processes of printing. Let’s look at the process of hand block printing, because it is quite similar to the

rubber stamps you are familiar with, and the seals you have made.

This is a carved wooden block. Notice the portions where the pattern is raised. This block has been carefully carved by an artist who specialises in wood carving. Do you have carpenters and wood carvers in your surroundings?

Meet them and show this picture, ask them how such a piece is carved. Inquire about the tools used and how much time it would take to handcarve this. This wooden block is used for printing on textiles. These textiles are called hand block printed textiles.

Look at the picture of a handblock printer and carefully place the inked block on cloth. The same block is used repeatedly to create a continuous pattern. He is making a special textile called Ajrakh, which is practiced in Kutchh, Gujarat.

Do you think you can create a pattern with your seal? You can even create another seal that is suitable for a continuous pattern. Make a few designs and try them.

## NOTE TO THE TEACHERS

Music holds the remarkable ability to evoke empathy, promote collaboration and facilitate self-expression. This book aims to motivate students to appreciate music and learn basic skills. It will be interesting to introduce specific songs and activities from the book which will encourage our students to participate enthusiastically and enjoy the process rather than solely focusing on specific outcomes, especially in the initial stages.

1. Practising at home helps to build skills like singing, playing of instrument, listening, creating, etc. It encourage students to do the same spontaneously.

2. Consider taking students to live musical performances for exposure.

3. Invite a musician to your school. Encourage children to ask questions and interact with the artist.

4. Learners love to sing songs that they hear at home, during religious and cultural celebrations. Encourage children to sing those songs in classroom that they learnt at home.

5. There are many opportunities to experience different genres of music in everyday life. In between classes, instead of ringing a school bell, consider playing a melody which will attract the attention of students.

6. There are many activities given in this section. You may add these activities for variations.

7. Most songs and activities in the book include an audio or video resource that can be accessed by scanning the QR code provided in the textbook.

This music curriculum desires that you and the students thoroughly enjoy the journey of making music. We aim to instill a lifelong love for music amongst them, fostering a deep appreciation that will grow beyond the classroom.


## Resources for the Classroom

1. The classroom should be a place where the music learning is fun and comfortable. Both students and teachers should be able to sit comfortably and sing together. Sitting on the floor is the best arrangement for music classes. It helps the children to learn about good posture and proper breathing, similar to the exercises done in yoga. Teachers can also change the seating in different styles and designs based on the theme of the song. This makes the class more interesting and creative, and helps students to foster improvisation skills.

2. Computer with internet connection, provision of downloading app for tanpura and speakers for playing audio resources.

3. Provision of material to make simple instruments in class.

4. Provision of microphone and sound system for performances in school.

5. Provision of simple


## instruments such _ as


## harmonium, dholak, manjira, shakers, tambourine, mouth organ, electronic tanpura and tabla.

6. A map of India will be useful to show the students the locations of the states from where different compositions in various languages originate and are practiced regularly.


## Note to the Teachers

The Malayalam song given here is an example to let students understand that music can convey emotions through melody and rhythm, even if the lyrics are in a language that students may not understand. You can play a song in a language that is unfamiliar to the students, to illustrate this point.

## ACTIVITY 3: LISTEN AND FEEL

We are surrounded by various types of music from dawn till dusk. Consider, your feelings when you hear different types of musical sounds. Recall the sounds of the shehnai, nadhaswaram, dhol, damru, edaikka or a melodious song — what do you feel while listening to these melodies? Do they make you happy, inspire you to dance, instil a sense of peace that you want to enjoy in silence or compel you to sing along? These feelings that come to life while hearing these melodious sounds are called emotions. Emotion is a natural trait inherent in all humans. Let us experience the same by listening to some instrumental music! What did you feel while listening to the musical pieces? Write down your emotions.

I’m bubbling with excitement for our school’s upcoming field trip to a safari! Standing in my room, surrounded by the soft chirping of birds outside, I sift through my wardrobe. I try on various outfits until I discover the perfect one. “Yes! This is the one!” I exclaim happily, feeling ready to explore the wild.


## Scene 2

After a long bus journey, we arrived at our destination. As we prepare to board the safari jeep, a gentle breeze sweeps through, causing the leaves to whisper and dance. The trees sway gracefully.

Animals have emotions like us. Have you observed that many birds and animals use sounds to communicate with each other? Birds use chirps to communicate. The Ganges river dolphin, the national aquatic animal of India, is blind, and uses a mixture of clicks and whistles to share messages. Male humpback whales are also famous for their long and intricate songs. Have you observed animals show

their feelings through sounds? Share some examples.

## Pitch and Dynamics

Have you ever noticed how you use different pitches and volume when youare happy, angry or sad? Pitch and dynamics are used to communicate emotions. Pitch tells us how high or low the note is and dynamics tells us how loud or soft a piece of music is.


## Rhythm

Rhythm is everywhere. Have you ever listened to your heart beats? Note how your walking rhythm is different from that of your grandparents? In music, rhythm is the pattern which has symmetrical beats, played with a song.


## The Swara Song

## ACTIVITY 4: MAKE YOUR OWN INSTRUMENT

Jaltarang is an interesting instrument that consists of a set of glass, metal or clay bowls each having varying levels of water. The artist strikes the rim of each bowl with a wooden stick and produces music. It is a melody and a rhythm instrument. We can categorise it as a wind instrument because the air present above the water level in each bowl vibrates to produce sound. This is also a percussive instrument because the sound is produced by striking a membrane or a surface, which is the rim of the bowls.

Let us make a jaltarang with the bowls that are available in your kitchen.

You will need

Five sturdy bowls, a can of water,


## and two pencils or wooden sticks.

Now, let us —


## ¢ Arrange the bowls ona table ina single row.

Fil the bowls with varying amounts of water. You could fill the first bowl with one cup of water, the second one with three-fourths cup, the third bowl with one-half cup, and the fourth bowl with one-fourth cup of water.

Your very own jaltarang is ready for use.

Gently strike the rim of every bowl with the pencil or stick, and make your own music. Observe how the pitch is different when you strike different bowls.

Mani Iyer introduced the concept of actively supporting the musical phrases on the mridangam rather than merely providing rhythmic support. He accompanied many leading artistes of his time. His fans also enjoyed his thani avartanams (solos). Many of his students became popular performers.


## Talam in Carnatic Music

In Carnatic music, talam is used to keep the beat. Each talam has a fixed number of beats and is repeated. This is known as talam cycle or avartanam. The parts of a talam are known as angams. The three angams are:

Laghu—This is a clap followed by counting of fingers. It can be 3, 4, 5, 7 or 9 beats. It is represented as | followed by the number of beats (as subscript).

When the laghu has three beats, we call it tishra jaati.

When the laghu has four beats, we call it chaturashra jaati.

When the laghu has five beats, we call it hhanda jaati.

When the laghu has seven beats, we call it mishra jaati.

When the laghu has nine beats, we call it sankeerna jaati.

Dhrutam—tThis is a clap followed by the wave of the hand. It has two beats. It is represented as O.

Anudhrutam— This is just a clap. It has one beat and is represented as U and it is less used in comparison to the above two.

Let us see how the laghu and dhrutam are presented in the form of tala.

Rupaka Talam—tThis talam has one dhrutam followed by one laghu. The chaturashra jaati rupaka talam therefore, is a cycle of six beats (4 + 2). It is represented as O |,.

Adi Talam—This talam has one laghu followed by two dhrutams. It is a cycle of eight beats (4 + 2 + 2). It is represented as |, O O.

## Ragas in Indian Music

There are two different styles of classical music in India—Carnatic or South Indian classical music, and Hindustani or North Indian classical music. The swaras in each style have been explained to you in the earlier pages. Carnatic music uses instruments like the veena, violin, flute, nadaswaram, mridangam, ghatam, kanjira and morsing. The compositions are usually in Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil language. Hindustani music uses instruments like the tanpura, sitar, sarod, sarangi, santoor, tabla, and pakhawaj. Songs are composed usually in Hindi, Sanskrit, and Brijbhasha.


## Watch videos about raga and tala.

Raga is based on a scale. Every scale has notes (swaras) in ascending (arohana) and descending (avarohana) order. Imagine a staircase made of swaras! The notes in the scale change according to the raga.

to understand


## Notation Scheme

When writing the notes in the higher octave (taar saptak), the notes are represented by a dot on top like this, S. The notes in the lower octave (mandra saptak) are represented by a dot below like this, N. The notes in the middle octave (madhya saptak) are represented by just the swara like this, S.


## Jaatis of Raga

Let us know another interesting terminology used for a specific set of notes in ragas. Ifa raga has five notes it is known as audav jaati. If a raga has six notes it is known as shadav Jaati. If a raga has seven notes it is known as sampoorna jaati.

Indian music has drawn greatly from the traditions and practices of the society. Bhakti or devotion, stands out as the primary motif in Indian musical expressions. Kirtan, shabad, hymns and qawwali exemplify


## this devotional aspect of music.


## Music


## Devotional Path to the Divine

Children must have seen people worshiping and singing different types of devotional compositions. Let us learn some of them.


## Kirtan


## Sung by Bharat Ratna Bhimsen Joshi Language: Marathi


## Je Kaa Ranjale Tyaasi Hone Jo Aapuley


## Tochi Sadhu Odey Khaawaa Dev Tethechi Janava


## Tukamane Saangu Kiti Tochi Bhagvantyacha Moorti

Meaning: This composition by Saint Tukaram is performed as an abhang kirtan. The song conveys the message, “Recognise a true human being as one who deeply feels, and empathises with the distress and pain of others. God resides in the hearts of such compassionate individuals.”


## Shabad

Nanak Chinta Mat Karo, Chinta Tis Hi Hay! Jal Meh Jant Upaaiyan, Tina Bhi Rozi Dey! Nanak Chinta Mat Karo, Chinta Tis Hi Hay! Othei Hatt Na Challaee, Na Ko Kirs Karey! Sauda Mool Na Hovaee, Na Ko Laye Na Dey! Jeea Ka Aahar Jeea, Khana Eho Karey! Vich Upaye Saayera, Tina Bhi Saar Karey! Nanak Chinta Mat Karo, Chinta Tis Hi Hey!

Meaning: Shabad is a song that is sung in gurudwaras. The song advises against worrying excessively because everything is ultimately determined by a divine will. God has created plants and creatures in water. He provides sustenance to them as well. Guru Nanak asks his disciples to stop worrying and have faith. Be it the river or the oceans, the creatures who live init are able to survive, as they live in accordance with the laws of nature. The Almighty takes care of all creatures.

Nottuswaram or Nottuswara is a term used in carnatic music to refer to a set of compositions created by the renowned composer Muthuswami Dikshitar.

Dikshitar composed 39 nottuswarams in total.

## Enactment: Abhinaya

Let us explore another element of dance that is an expression,

Expressions or bhavas are your own feelings, seen on your face or are the feelings of others as seen by you. They are known as navarasas (shringara or beauty), hasya (humour), karuna (greif and compassion), veera (bravery), raudra (anger), bhayanaka (fearful), veebhatsa (disgust), adbhuta (wonder), shanta (calm).

Look at your friends, teachers and parents ... everyone has at least some expression on their face. Isn’t it?


## Reprint 2025-26

Note down these expressions and try to identify their names. For example, worry, fear, surprise, joy, guilt, anger, humor, sorrow and disgust.

As you assemble in the dance class, have a discussion together on expressions seen earlier on each other’s faces and make a note of the same.

How many expressions can you identify? Can you connect the expressions to the navarasas?

Wow! Have you done such an activity before?

Can you express your feelings with facial expressions and your body?

How did you feel expressing different feelings?

## ACTIVITY 4: PRACTICE HASTAMUDRAS

According to Natyashastra, written by Bharatamuni, the hastamudras or hand gestures are used both to embellish the dance but more importantly for abhinaya, narrating stories with special gestures of dance.

In dance, characters are sometimes performed by a single dancer irrespective of their gender. In many traditional performances of dance, men often play the women characters.


## Bhakti movement

Bhakti movement, starting around sixth or seventh century AD influenced the development of regional classical dance forms which expand the roots of our present day classical dances.

In the bhakti period, dancers became part of the pooja rituals inside the temple. The Devadasis and Tevadichhis of Southern India and the Maharis of Odisha directly served the deity inside the temple.

The 64 rituals are performed through ritualistic dance in the Sattaras of Assam and the Bhagavatars in the South. The Kathakars of the North sang and

## THEATRE FOR MIDDLE STAGE


## Creative, Positive and Joyful

In a subject like theatre, which is about stories, expression and imagination, there will be no wrong answer. Encouraging students to think out of the box, experiment with ideas and express themselves in unique ways would be an ideal environment. A classroom that feels safe for a child to share their ideas freely, without being mocked at or laughed at is what will make a theatre class fruitful. Building this mindset in teachers as well as among the children to encourage mutual respect and support among classmates is a great way to foster holistic learning.


## Connect Theatre to Real World Skills

As the children begin to understand more about the world around them, facing situations and handling emotions that are more complicated than before, theatre becomes evenmore relevant. Emphasising the skills gained through theatre becomes crucial. Emotional skills like empathy gender and handling failure along with life skills such as public speaking, problem-solving and teamwork help students recognise the practical applications of theatre, beyond being an actor or a director.


## Attend Performances

Encouraging students to watch live performances or bring guest artists and expose them to professional

theatre and inspire their own artistic aspirations would go a long way in theatre education.


## Understand Individual Learning Styles

Recognise and accommodate diverse learning styles within your class. Some students may thrive with hands-on activities, while others may prefer written or visual learning. Provide an option for the child to choose their mode of communication (written or oral) and keep the focus on the conceptual understanding. This takes away the stress from the child’s mind to allow free thinking and creativity.


## Emphasise Collaboration

Theatre is a collaborative art form. Build in teamwork and communication skills by incorporating group activities, ensemble performances, and collaborative projects. This not only builds team skills, but also enhances individual character and aptitude.


## Circle Time

A practice to be followed by the teacher in every class. The last 10 minutes of the period are allotted to this circle time. All children, along with the teacher sit together, for what seems like an informal reflection of thoughts and opinions. Children open up freely when they know there are no expectations, no marks or grades attached. This can be a source of crucial information that no test or exam can provide. But this is informal only for the child. The teachers are required to take notes for themselves, that can be applied in their next lesson plans.

SCENE 1 UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS As we start our first theatre class,

write one word to describe how you are feeling.

We will now explore, experiment and play with emotions! Sounds like fun? Let us now get on the HOT SEAT.

Instructions: The default position is—heads down. Eyes closed. Pay attention.

You will hear a story. Listen to it carefully. Start imagining. Be fully involved in the story. The story suddenly stops and you will hear the word —‘LOOK’. You have to look up quickly and react to that situation in the story where it stopped.

Basic: Simple situation that ends in a dramatic reaction.

## Example 1


## Default Position

School trip is announced and you are excited to tell your mother. You

are walking on the road, it starts raining. You started running.

Since you cannot see well, you miss a step and fall into the drain.. Now... LOOK!

Advanced: Story continues after the first reaction. They FREEZE in the last reaction and continue to listen... and react at LOOK. Many twists and turns can be brought into the story, asking for areaction at every twist in the tale!

7/15/2024 11:48:41 AM


## Example 2


## Default Position

You are the princess, who is riding a horse in the forest. When you hear a ¢ familiar voice, you turn back. That face looks very familiar.

You try really hard to recall... and recall. It is the person in the ancestral photo which is 500 years old.


## Now... LOOK!


## Freeze

You then try to escape from this person. But he is following you. You go faster... that person trips ona rockand something falls out of the pocket. The toy you were playing with yesterday! LOOK!


## Freeze

‘How did my toy from yesterday reach him? Oh wait...I lost it in the bushes outside the palace.’ ) Cousin who was playing with you must have stolen it. You take courage and pull the coat to reveal his true face. It is your naughty cousin! LOOK!


## Theatre

Extended: Children volunteer to create stories of their own and narrate with ‘POSITION’, ‘FREEZE’ and ‘LOOK’, while the other children react.


## It is Circle Time!

Make a list of all the emotions we experienced today.

What do you think was the most complicated emotion? Why?

¢ Is there a feeling or emotion you can’t name? Can you describe it?

You know, there are some situations when you can feel two emotions, at the same time. For example, you are playing with your friends and you

115


## 4Theatre.indd 116

lose the game because one of them cheated. What are the two emotions? sad (for losing the game) and angry (a friend cheated).

What emotions would you feel when you see a puppy getting drenched in the rain, but you cannot go out to help because you have a cold and it is raining heavily.


## and

We all go through such combination of emotions. Sometimes it could be three emotions too! But that is fine, as long as you know what emotions you are experiencing. Since you can now not only identify your emotions but can also name them; it is very important to look within yourself in different situations and identify what you are going through.

All of us go through many emotions every day. People have been thinking about emotions for many centuries. We, by just playing a game, could list out so many names of emotions. Imagine how many they must have listed after having


## Reprint 2025-26

116

worked on it for years! How many do you think they must have listed? 50? 100? More? Actually, it is ... NINE!

Just nine? How? What about the others? Who are these people?

After years of study, observation and analysis, the ancient rishis of our country classified emotions into the concept of ‘Navarasa’. Can you believe that all the emotions that we have discussed, can be categorised under these nine rasas?

This is primarily done on the basis of two fundamental elements — rasa and bhava.


## Bhava Dominant state of mind.

Based on perception, thoughts and attitudes, it does not change easily.


## leads to


## Rasa

The emotional essence. The resulting experience that is felt ina situation, feeling or sentiment.

7/15/2024 11:48:43 AM

Have you noticed this—in a situation, what you feel is different from what your friend feels. The reason is the difference in bhava in both of you. Because you had a different bhava (different attitude or thought) it gave rise to a different rasa (feeling that was experienced).


## Examples

1. You are watching a match of your favourite sport with your friend. Your team wins. You are thrilled. Your friend is happy but not very excited because his favourite player did not score well.

2. You are having lunch with your friend. A bully in class comes and makes fun of the both of you, laughs and goes away. You get irritated, but put it away and say ‘who cares’. You notice that your friend is crying in a corner, feeling very hurt.

In both these cases, though the situations are the same, what emotion and experience rise (rasa) depends on what basic attitude or thoughts you have (bhava).

The great rishis of India, had thought of this in their work on emotions and the human mind. Based on their study, they classified the rasas (our experience) into navarasas (nine rasas).

Sringara Hasya Veera Beauty, love Humour, Heroic, happy courage Bhayanaka Karuna Bhibhatsa Fear, scary Sympathy, sad Disgust, ugly y Raudra Adbhuta Shanta Anger, rage Wonder, Peace, surprise blissful

## 4Theatre.indd 118

Now, you can fit all the emotions that we have discussed, into one of these nine rasas! Try doing it.


## Navarasa Game

Play this fun game to get familiar with thenavarasas. Draw the navarasas in a circle in the centre of the room. All children go around the circle when the music is played. The music stops and the rasa that is nearest to the child should be expressed. The learner who will not able to perform, will go out of the circle. Music is played again and so it goes on.

Alternatively, nine boxes can be drawn on the floor instead of a circle.

This concept of rasa, is a very small part of the big work on performing arts. It has everything from the most basic idea of how to read a story to the possibility of attaining moksha through the arts! It speaks about everything including make-up, costume, lights, music, dance, rehearsals, discipline, safety and responsibility of the arts towards the audience. This great work on the performing arts is called Natyashastra, written by Bharata Muni.


## Reprint 2025-26

An interesting story of how it all began, called Natyotpatti (birth of performing art)

Brahma, the God of all Devas, noticed that the Devas had become very demotivated and

lazy. They wasted time doing nothing.

So, Brahma calls an intelligent Rishi — Bharata Muni and asks him to simplify the Natyaveda so that everyone understands this.


## Theatre

Brahma then picks dialogue from Rigveda, movement from Yajurveda, music from Samaveda and emotions from Atharvaveda.


## ty —

Bharata Muni then writes the Natyashastra. He gets his 100 children together to apply the Natyashastra and presents a performance.

He created a unique book Natya Veda. He gives it to the Devas hoping they will like it and use it.


## But the Devas don’t

understand anything in Natyaveda. They are very confused.

7 The Devas are thrilled looking at the performing arts. They shower praises and appreciation and adapt it in their lives.

This story tells us that the Natyashastra is a book on the performing arts that includes the knowledge extracted from all the four Vedas and more! It is also called the fifth Veda! This story of Natyotpatti is how the actual book of Natyashastra begins. If you have read this story, it means you have started reading the Natyashastra itself! We shall continue learning more about it in the forthcoming classes.

## Dionysus — Greek God of entertainment

The oldest known origin of performing arts outside of India, is the Greek Theatre, around fifth century BCE.

Dionysus, the God of entertainment, was responsible to maintain a good crop harvest of grapes— main agricultural produce in Greece. Back then, the people of Greece used to celebrate the Dionysian festival to please their God. During this, they used to sing hymns in praise of Dionysus and the chorus was called Dithyramb. As a part of the ritual, a goat was sacrificed while the songs were sung.

Songs sung during the goat sacrifice ritual (ode) led to the term ‘Tragodia’ (Trag—Odia), which means the ‘Song of the Goats’, which led to the term, tragedy.

Stories and performances based on this were the first plays. They were all tragic plays. They were serious and had a sad ending with the protagonist (the main character) of the play either being punished or dead.

More and more such stories were being performed and many years


## Reprint 2025-26

122

later, (around fourth century BCE) the stories began to see changes where there were happy endings and enjoyment in the story. This was the beginning of comedy. The origin of the word comedy, similar to tragedy, is from the Greek terms — ‘Komos’ (enjoy) and ‘Odia’ (song). Comedy dramas have a happy ending. These include elements of humans, animals and Gods in their plays. They also included dance sequences and a dialogue directly with the audience or the playwright.

Observe this picture of a Greek theatre performance. What do you notice? All three actors are wearing masks.


## A Greek play in action

7/15/2024 11:48:52 AM

Masks were an important part of Greek theatre. This is also linked to the reason why they preferred tragedy.

Tragedy is actually serious and sad. Did the Greeks like to be sad and cry all the time? No. It helped them to release their suppressed emotions and pain. This is called catharsis. You will learn more about it in higher grades. Masks helped in relating to the character and not the person acting.

You must have seen these masks many times, right? But what do you think they represent? You can guess from what we have studied.

## SCENE 3: THEATRE PRODUCTION

In any successful performance, we see the actors perform and get the appreciation. But for the actors’ performance to have full impact on the audience, the effort and work ofall these departments are very crucial. We are now going to explore the basics of the following departments —

0680CHI7


## ¢ Make-up * Costume design ¢ Stage layout

Your face is the first thing that people notice about you. So, for an actor, to look convincing on stage, the first thing that has to be considered is make-up.

Make-up Have you noticed actors have colours on their face? Some look good, some look scary and some look funny. This is what make-up can do! It is all planned as per the roles they play in the drama performance that they are a part of. Everyone performing on stage needs to put on make-up, irrespective of the gender, age, community, etc.

If you ask, but why? Why is make-up necessary? We don’t wear


## kriti-I | Grade 6

make-up in our everyday life. Why is


## it necessary for stage?

Here is your answer —

1. Visibility and Projection: Make-up enhances facial features, ensuring that expressions and emotions are projected to the audience, even from a distance.

2. Character Transformation:

Make-up room, also called Make-up is a powerful tool green room, should be bright, for transforming actors into well-lit and airy characters. It allows performers

to look old, younger or adopt specific features necessary for the role, enhancing the overall authenticity of the performance.

3. Highlighting Facial Expressions: Make-up helps emphasise key features such as eyes and mouth, so that subtle nuances are visible to the audience.

4. Harmony with Stage Lighting: Stage lights can be intense and may distort natural skin tones. Make-up is applied to create a balance, preventing actors from appearing washed out or overly dark under the stage lights.


## Reprint 2025-26


## 4Theatre.indd 128

128

5. Historical and Theatrical Styles: Depending on the play’s setting or genre, make-up can be essential for capturing the styles. It allows actors to fit into specific time periods, cultures or fantasy worlds envisioned by the director.

In essence, make-up for stage actors is not just about ‘looking good’ or aesthetics. It is a practical and artistic necessity, as it contributes significantly to the success of a theatrical performance. It enables actors to communicate effectively with the audience, enhances their portrayal of characters and contributes to the overall visual impact of the production.

Depending on the play and role, there are different types of make-up.


## ¢ Straight make-up: Simple, basic highlight of features.

¢ Character make-up: Elements of age, profession, personality and situation are shown.

Special effects: Adding wounds, scars or additional features like horns.

7/15/2024 11:49:02 AM

Identify and write the type of make-up based on the description above


## Theatre

Fantasy or abstract make-up: Creating unique, unfamiliar characters with unusualcolours. Mime or pattern make-up: A bold, striking face covers that is usually neutral.

Face is the first thing that people notice. The next most important thing, is the clothes and accessories. A person’s character is defined by the kind of clothes they wear. So, invariably for characters on stage, what is very crucial is—


## The Costume Design

We wear different types of clothes in different occasions. The clothes you wear at home are different

from the school uniform. Likewise, the clothes you wear to the temple

during a village festival is different from your night clothes. Right? Similarly, an actor wears different clothes to portray different characters. It helps the audience to recognise and relate to the character. While there are so many kinds of clothes and options to choose from, how does one even start to decide what works for the character? Here are some points to start off—costumes are designed according to the following categories: ¢ Gender: Clothes are different for men and women. ¢ Age of the character: People dress differently at different ages. ¢ Timeline of the play: Fashion of a culture evolves and changes as time progresses. (Jeans and pants did not exist during Maharaja Shivaji’s time.) ¢ Geographical location of the story: Differences in cultures and countries. (Traditional clothing of Karnataka is different from Bengal).

129


## 4 Theatre.indd 130


## kriti-I | Grade 6


## ¢ Occupation of the character: A police, a lawyer and a doctor.

¢ Features of the character: person wearing shabby clothes and neatly dressed.

How are all these elements

brought about in design with the use of: Fabric or Material: Match the time period and the geographicallocation. (Using synthetic chiffon for a story in the Himalayas of ancient India —is not possible because chiffon did not exist in ancient India and this would not suit the cold weather in Himalayas).

130

Colours: They represent numerous things like: ¢ Time period (neon blue is preferably not used for a scene in Vedic period). ¢ Each colour of character represents a meaning. (Negative character has dark shades.) ¢ Cultural aspects (red is not used in mourning or funeral scenes). Pattern and Designs: There are some patterns on the clothes that are exclusive to the royalty, some represent tribal culture while there are some exclusive to a rural setting. Styling: Jewellery, accessories like crown, dupatta, belts, bags, eyewear.

## Stage Trivia


## The word ‘Theatre’

originated from the name of the Greek performance space ‘Theatron’.


## Theatre

So, costumes are on, makeup is done, but, where do you stage it?

The answer is right there in the question!

ON A STAGE!

A stage is any place where you perform a play. There are various types of stages which we can observe throughout the history of theatre. Plays have been staged in so many venues, starting from the Indian Natyagruha, Greek ‘Theatron’ (carved out mountains) to the Globe Theatre (in a palace like setting), to the streets and finally to the modern indoor auditorium named proscenium. The proscenium is the most popular and commonly used structure in today’s shows.


## The Proscenium

The origins of the proscenium stage is directly linked to the scientific discoveries of electricity and the light bulbs.

Previously, most of the plays happened either during the day

when the sunlight lit the stage or at night, when they relied on heavy oil lamps to light the stage, as these were practised in ancient time. Later, with the help of electricity and light bulbs, many aspects of light and intensity could be controlled.

This allowed theatrical performances to be done indoors, where neither the burning hot sunlight, the cold winds nor heavy rains would prevent shows from being staged.


## Parts of the Stage

Side Wings: The sides of the stage are divided by wings, which help actors to take entries and exits from the stage.

Apron: It is a curved space which extends from the stage area onto the audience area. This space is generally used to place foot mikes and foot lights.

Proscenium: The proscenium is the frame or arch that surrounds the stage in a proscenium theatre. Cyclorama: A large light blue or white fabric stretched across the

back wall of the stage used to reflect lighting equipment and create effects such as sky, clouds, etc.

Activity In order to put together all that has been learnt, do the following —

1. Pick your favourite story.

2. Identify two of your favourite characters. Design costumes and make-up for them. (Create your own. Don’t copy from the storybook you have read).

134

3. Make a cardboard model of a stage with side wings as given in the picture. (This can be done in groups).

4. Plan how one scene can be enacted on stage, by placing the set and properties (chairs, table or tree, hut, etc).

Alternatively, make a drawing of this in your book.

## SCENE 4: WRITE, RIGHT

A script is the storyteller’s brush, painting worlds with words, inviting characters to dance and crafting the magic that

captivates the audience.

Having a good script is the first step towards a successful performance. Just like the foundation of a building is the most important aspect of having a strong structure, the right script creates the right base for all the creativity and talent to grow.

Let us first start with understanding the words and terms that are commonly used—story, drama, script, dialogue. Are they all same? No!

A drama is a story being told in a live format. Characters come to life and situations happen in front of you. But when it is in the form of a script (written form), it is not the same as a story?

What is the difference between story and drama script?


## Activity (In class)

Story Building Instructions: Everyone sits in a circle (can also sit attheir places ifcircle is not possible). The teacher will start with the first sentence. Each of you add one line to build a story. Listen carefully to what the last sentence was. You have to continue from there.

Don’t be in a hurry to complete the story. Try to make the stories interesting and complex.

Basic: Each of you will tell one line until everyone gets an opportunity. The last set of children need to make sure they conclude it.


## Discussion

Was it an interesting story? Where do you think it got boring? Can you define what a story is? Is it the same as a drama script?

What are the things you notice in a drama script that is different from your story book? Name a few that are unique.

135


## kriti-I | Grade 6

A story is a narrative

or account of events, experiences or adventures, real or imaginary presented in a structured or coherent form. It typically involves a series of connected events that unfold over time, often featuring characters who face challenges, undergo transformations and contribute to the overall development of the narrative.

A conversation is

an interactive, verbal exchange between two or more people. It is a social and communicative

process where participants take turns in speaking and listening, engaging in a dialogue that may be casual, formal or structured.

A striking difference is that the story is in the form of a paragraph, while the script has ‘conversations’.

I’m sure you see or hear people having conversations every day. At home, on the road, in schools — everywhere. Let us try to write a simple conversation between a shopkeeper and customer. It can be from what you have seen or completely imaginary.

Use your notebook if you want to continue the conversation. It can be as long as you want.

Congratulations you have written your first script!!

Let us now go to the next level. If you carefully observe, the script you have written is different from a drama you have watched or a story you have heard. What is it that is missing?

7/15/2024 11:49:10 AM

Conflict is the struggle or disagreement between characters or elements within the story that create obstacles and take the story forward. Conflict is a fundamental element

in storytelling, as it

introduces challenges, dilemmas or opposing forces that characters must resolve.

This tension is essential for building interest, engaging the audience and providing a framework for character development in a script.

## Hare and tortoise in arace

Here is an instance of how conflict is used in this popular story that all of us know—‘Hare and Tortoise.’

If you notice the ‘middle’, we talk about a ‘problem’. This is the most important part of any story or script. It is called — ‘the conflict’.

## Example 1— Conversation without conflict

Customer: Namaste! I want a chocolate for my sister’s birthday. Shopkeeper: Okay. What kind of chocolate do you want?

Customer: My sister likes vanilla flavoured chocolates.

Shopkeeper: We have three varieties. Plain vanilla, vanilla with nuts, and wafers with vanilla and chocolate in it.

Customer: I will have the vanilla with nuts.

Shopkeeper: Do you want a gift wrapping?


## Customer: Yes, please.

Shopkeeper: Here you go, chocolate wrapped in gift paper! It will cost you =50.

Customer: Here is the money. Thank you!

Let us see how the conflict will make a difference. Example 2— Conversation with conflict

Customer: Namaste! I want a chocolate for my sister’s birthday.

Shopkeeper: Okay. What kind of chocolate? Customer: My sister likes vanilla chocolates. Shopkeeper: Sorry, we have three varieties. Plain, strawberry and caramel.

Customer: Oh, but my sister likes vanilla. It’s okay. Give me caramel and please wrap it in gift paper.

Customer: This is not fair. First, you did not have the chocolate I wanted, now you don’t have the gift wrap! I will go to the other shop. I don’t want anything from here. Shopkeeper: Hey... wait... I will try to arrange it (picks up the phone and talks to someone). Don’t worry. You are getting the vanilla chocolate and the gift wrap. I am getting it for you from our storage. Sorry for the trouble.


## Customer: No problem. Thank you!

Has the conflict in the second example ignited some emotion and drama into the otherwise boring conversation you saw in the first example? This is how you can make your entire script interesting.

Now, go back and check if you have a conflict in the shopkeeper conversation you wrote. Did you also have a conflict in the story building game? Let us play it again.


## Activity (In class —continued)

Let’s play level two of the same story building game. Instructions: Everyone sits in a circle (can sit in their respective places if a circle is not possible). The teacher will start with the first sentence. Each of you add one line to build a story. Listen carefully to what the last sentence was. You have to continue from there.

Don’t be in a hurry to complete the story. Try to make the stories interesting and complex.

Advanced: Make 10-15 chits with random phrases written, like, ‘The protagonist forgets to’ or ‘This character is very hungry’ or ‘Suddenly the lights went out’. These are meant to bring a ‘twist-in-the-tale’ or in a more professional language, that you now know—these are ‘conflicts’.

Like you did_ previously, contribute a sentence to the story. After every ten lines you pick out a chit, there is a twist in the tale and you have to include in the story. Pay attention to the Beginning-Middle -End. The last set of children have to resolve the conflict and conclude.

Play this game as many times as you want. Change the order of the children. It will help you (them) to get familiar with the flow of the story, conflict and its resolution. With such understanding of the basics, you can now get down to some serious script writing.

Here are simple steps to write your own play! First make notes in your book about the three parts —

These troupes had everyone —make-up men, costume tailors, set designers, painters, light technicians, actors, dancers, singers, writers, cooks, managers and accountants. Most of the time, it had entire families including children, being a part of it! They worked together performing shows and travelling for their entire lives.

The very first company theatre troupes that travelled to different regions in India were the ‘parsi theatre companies’ in Bombay, Maharashtra, that performed plays all over India during the 1850s to 1930s.

The first Parsi theatre company called ‘Parsi Natak Mandali’ performed their first play, Roostum Zabooli, and Sohrab in 1853. It was followed by King Afrasiab, Rustom Pehlvan and Padsah Faredun. By

tradition and history. This is one of the few troupes that has survived since 138 years. Surabhi theatre still showcases the following plays —


## Sri Krishna Leelalu: The exploits of little Krishna.


## Jai Pathala Bhiravi: The story of folk legend Thota Ramaudu.

Bhakta Prahlada: The tale of Prahlada —a devoted child.


## Maya Bazar: The tale of demon King Ghatothkacha.

Sri Venkateshwara Udhbhavam (Srinivasa Kalyanam). Balanagamma: The story of a wicked sorcerer.

Karnataka Nataka Mandali was established in 1874 at Gadag in Karnataka. Sakkere Balacharya (Shantha Kavi) is the person behind this. Plays like Kichaka, Banasura and Vatstrapaharana were very popular on the stage.

Around the same time, Halasangi Nataka Mandali was started at Halasangi, Bijapur district of Karnataka. Srimati Parinaya, Madalasa_ __Parinaya,

Droupadi_ Vatstrapaharana, and Bhoumasura Vadhe, etc., written by Venkannacharya Agalagatti were also popular.

They had the patronage of the Maharajas of Mysore, who supported them and donated liberally towards encouraging the performing arts.

Shree Channabasaweshwara Nataka Mandali or famously the Gubbi Company, was the most famous theatre company in Karnataka. Their popular plays Sadharame, Subhadra, Hemareddy Mallamma, among many others always ran houseful shows. People waited in queues for days to buy tickets to watch them!

Some unique features —

¢ This troupe was the first to allow women to act.

¢ The most famous Kannada actor Dr Rajkumar started his theatre career in this company.

¢ BV Karanth, the famous theatre director from Karnataka also started his career here.


## The Present Situation

The era of company theatres in India slowly declined after Independence. There were many factors that led to the decline — ¢ Most companies were not managed with the financial efficiency required.


## Reprint 2025-26

¢ The novel techniques of the cinema industry stood as a very strong contender.

e Content and stories became less family friendly as some companies resorted to unhealthy humour.

¢ The concept of amateur theatre or Havyasi theatre gained popularity for its convenience.


## Professional Theatre in India

At present, there has been a decline in company theatre, there are many professional repertoires that provide high quality productions, even to this day. With the development of science and technology, theatre techniques have also upgraded and this allows for enhanced experiences.

## CHAPTER 19 STORIES OF SHADOWS AND STRINGS — PUPPETRY

All of us have played with dolls, cars and rockets, creating stories and characters, right? We have made our little toy save someone in distress or have an adventure in a chocolate dreamland. This is exactly what puppetry is!

Puppetry is the art of using inanimate figures or representations to create a performance. Puppeteers manipulate these figures through various techniques such as hand movement, strings or rods, to tell stories, entertain or convey messages in front of an audience.


## SCENE 5: HAND PUPPETERY — FINGER, SOCKS AND GLOVE

Puppets come in all shapes and sizes. There is no specific rule about how a puppet should look like. It can be as unique as your creative imagination. Let us start with the simplest of

all—your hand! Make simple faces of the characters you want to create (from your family or friends) and make them talk!

Alternatively, you can also draw your hand on a paper and create characters.

## Activity

Create two characters. Use your imagination. It can be people, animals or imaginary characters like aliens. You can also create combinations like a tiger and a ghost, or old man and a dog.

List out characteristics. Give a name and emotion —are they funny, angry or sad?, assign a style of talking.

Write a simple conversation. Remember the three parts of a script? Make sure that you have a situation and a conflict where these two characters talk.

## Puppetry Trivia

¢ Puppets were used to tell stories in India for more than three thousand years. There’s an interesting story by Rishi Vyasa in the Bhagavata Purana. This talks about wooden puppets being controlled with strings.

Farmers, after working whole day relaxed by performing and

watching puppet shows.

## SCENE 6: STICK AND SHADOW PUPPETRY

Thisis a form of puppetry thatrequires some hasic set up. It can be done by you either in the class or at home. You will need some basic material that you can find around you.

While you could do hand puppets and sock puppets on your own, these two forms require you to work in teams. So, go find your gang of puppeteers!

Class is to be divided into teams of five to six children. Each team will decide a concept or a story they want to narrate. Each group will create a simple script with three to four characters in it. The team then works together to make the puppets.


## Stick Puppets

Stick puppets are the easiest to make and will also let children have lots of fun. ¢ Draw and colour pictures of all the characters in your story and cut them to shape.

¢ Find sticks that are at least six inches or longer. It can be twigs from a tree, ice-cream sticks or even cardboard strips that are stiff.


## ¢ Glue the pictures of the

characters you have drawn to one end of the stick such that, you hold one end and the puppet is on the other end (see picture).

Your stick puppets are ready!


## Puppet Show Frame

Cut out a cardboard in a simple rectangle, big enough to fit in all the characters you have created.

149


## kriti-I | Grade 6


## 4 Theatre.indd 150

Optional: You can decorate the frame with suitable pictures according to your script.

You can also add a suitable background picture of a forest or a street, etc.

You are ready for the show!

Each team member takes up one character and the team enacts the puppet show.

Now that you have the stick puppetry show ready, shadow puppetry is just one step away.


## Shadow Puppets

You can add a white cloth on the cardboard frame and use a pointed single source of light, like a torch. Some points to keep in mind for shadow puppetry —

e Make sure the light doesn’t spread too much as_ the sharpness of the shadow depends on it. The light should be placed on a stable surface, so it doesn’t move.

¢ The outline of the character is the most important as the


## Reprint 2025-26

colour, facial features, etc., are not visible in the shadow. The outline should be able to tell your audience the character. As you try working your way by creating stories through shadow puppetry, let us find out how much progress we have made as a country, in the art of shadow puppetry.

But who will deliver the dialogues? Do Puppets talk? No! Can you talk? Yes! But that will sound like you... How will you ‘sound like’ your character?


## Answer: Voice modulation

Voice modulation in puppetry is giving your puppet different voices to match its feelings or the story it is telling. So, when your puppet is happy, you can make your voice sound cheerful and high-pitched. If it’s telling a spooky tale, you can lower your voice to make it sound mysterious just like how you play with different voices when you pretend to be different characters.


## Reprint 2025-26

152

You can do the same with your puppet to make the show more exciting and fun!

This is very important when you are playing two characters yourself. Won't it be boring to hear the same voice for both characters, which also sounds like your regular voice? So, both characters should sound different from each other and from your own voice.

This is true for any kind of puppetry, whether you do sock puppetry, stick puppetry or shadow puppetry. You have to work on your voice. Remember, it has to suit the character the puppet is representing!

Example—An old man cannot have a high-pitched squeaky voice!

## CHAPTER 20 THE GRAND FINALE

This is a fun attempt to put together all that you have learnt into one project. This project can be done both individually or in a group with the help of your friends.

Write a simple conversation between two or three characters, based on one emotion. Make sure the conversation mainly has the emotion you have chosen. Example: emotion chosen is anger. The main character could be short tempered or two friends could be discussing about how someone’s anger cancause a lot of problem.

3. Stage Design

Use the cardboard stage model to plan the set and props on stage.

Use this to plan your final performance in class, where you set up the stage and act out the script with your friends.

Discussion and Feedback: After presenting or performing in front of your class, discuss each aspect of your workers in detail. This is very important for every artiste.

1. Script—Did they understand the story? Was the conflict and resolution clear?

2. Costume and make-up — Was it neat? Does it add to the character or disturb the performance?

4. Switch to Puppetry

Cut out the outline of your costume design picture and paste a stick on one end. Do this for all your characters. The stick puppets are ready!

Now, you can use the same stage model as your puppetry frame!

3. Stage—Were the design and props well used?

4. What could have made the over-all show better?

Take both positive and negative feedback with the same approach. It will only help you do better next time, as you will not repeat the same mistakes.

155

You have just learnt the basic steps of the process of how a theatrical performance takes shape. But there is more! Next you will look into more detailed steps of how to improve on your script and performances to make it look professional. It will definitely be more exciting and engaging than how it has been.

Feel free to write and create more scripts and small shows either with friends or with puppets, whenever you are free. You can use a story you read, a movie you watched or imagine something new all by yourself.

As the stanza from Natyashastra in the beginning of this section says, theatre will not only help you learn about the performing arts but also build the crucial life skills you will need in future. So, make use of this wonderful art to explore yourselves.

Try out all new ideas confidently as there is no wrong answer here! While you create new stories and present them, remember — have FUN!

Happy creating till we meet again!

## INTEGRATION OF ALL ART FORMS

We all know that we have come to the final part of the book. We have learned about different aspects of all the four art forms. Now it’s time to collaborate them all together. Let’s learn how we can integrate them all in a single activity.

First of all, let’s have a story, then we will figure out the parts where we can use elements of one particular art form.

Sounds fun? Did you realise that in this tiny story, all the art forms are woven together? Let’s decode?

Seal— you did it in the chapter of this book as an activity of Visual Arts.

Local and regional songs and dance —you have learnt so many in the Music and Dance periods.

You have learnt all _ the dialogues and expressions of joy, fear, and surprise in Theatre activities and now you also know how to create them.

0680CH21


## Story example

Two friends were playing at the edge of the forest, and found a mystery seal with a secret code. They went on an adventure to unravel the secret code. But they were unable to find anything and realised that they were lost in the jungle. They were almost ready to give up. Right moment at that one of them saw some indigenous people dancing in front of their God. Kids got caught! Those people took both of them to their village. The kids were very scared and planned to escape. Just as they were about to leave, they noticed that all the huts in the village have the same design as in the seal. They showed their seal to those people and somehow made them understand that they found the seal in the jungle and also got lost. After seeing their sacred seal, all the villagers of the forest were thrilled to make friends with them. They showed them around and told them that they worship the Earth as their God.


## kriti-I | Grade 6 DO YOU KNOW

The Pancha (five) Tattva (elements) or Pancha Bhuta are the five basic elements. These are earth, water, fire, air and space.


## 5 Integration of All Art Forms.indd 158

Now do you realise how beautifully we can connect them all to construct a story. Well, go ahead and create your own.

The suggested theme is ‘Earth and Water’ of Pancha Tattva—the five elements of nature.


## INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY

Let us discuss about the two elements — Earth and Water.

Firstly, identify the areas, problem areas or issues which we can showcase by different art forms. For example, if we choose soil pollution, we can make a campaign of photography or make some posters (visual art). We can also write a song with motivational lyrics

Element Elements Elements of of Theatre Music (Sounds, (Emotions, Rhythms, Actions, Emotions, Words) Words) Earth and Water


## Reprint 2025-26

158

and compose it in an energetic tune (music), or practise dance steps as well in this particular song (dance), and even make a short skit, drama or nukkad natak and incorporate all the above said elements of art.

Apply your knowledge and skills of music, theatre, dance and visual art to develop a project to express your ideas, emotions and concerns related to earth and water.

You can continue doing this activity whenever you think of a different way to connect an art form with the five elements in nature. As you continue thinking about these connections, we will start working in groups in the fun activity which can be played as a game.


## Elements of Visual Art (Lines, Shapes, Colours, Textures)

Elements of Dance (Rhythms,


## Movement, Expressions)

7/10/2024 3:52:55 PM

Remember that the way you connect the elements might be different from how your friends connect the elements. Fill in this table according to your ideas. You can use your notebook or a separate sheet of paper if you need more space to write or draw.


## Integration of All Art Forms


## Group Activity or Team Work

You will choose a topic or an issue or problem area related to Earth and water just like the individual activity. Here are some thought provoking ideas for your young minds. Have you thought of the quality of soil, or source of drinking water in your locality or natural resources around you? Can you describe a pond, lake or river and its ecosystem, the range of hills that you see, the beauty of the waterfall you visited recently?

Can you imagine a day without water or can you imagine living in a very dirty and polluted land? Well, we can always try and make some positive changes through the arts because art is not only a skill to develop but also has the potential to make social changes and reforms. The knowledge of art brings sensitivity and awareness in us about everything because we start appreciating small things, beauty and changes around us.

Now, are you ready for some brainstorming exercises?


## Instructions 1. Make five sets of chits. Each

set has the activities associated with a particular art form written in those chits. (Use the list below to write activities.)


## . Divide the class into two or

three groups, to have about 10-12 members in each group. Each group chooses either ‘earth’ (prithvi) or ‘water’ (jala) as their area of work.


## . One representative from each

group picks one chit from each set. So each group now has one activity each from theatre, music, visual art and dance. The chit under ‘values’ can be used as a theme to bring together all the artforms.


## . Now, sit with your group and

develop an integrated project that involves all the art forms. Create your own production and present it to the class.

## ASSESSMENT

Assessments in art education play a crucial role in understanding and nurturing students’ creative abilities and artistic growth. Unlike traditional subjects, art education assessments focus on evaluating a wide range of skills including creativity, critical thinking, technical proficiency, and expressive capabilities. These assessments are designed not only to measure progress and mastery but also to encourage exploration, self-expression, and a _ deeper appreciation for arts.


## METHODS OF ASSESSMENTS

As the assessment processes are primarily skill-based, it is not

dependent on the ‘correct or wrong answer’ given by the child. It is therefore important not to structure ‘tests’ with question papers and written answers. This would entirely defeat the purpose of the approach

0680CH22

used in an art education curriculum. A variety of assessment methods such as portfolios, performance reviews, project based evaluations and reflective self-assessments, can give insights into a student’s unique and artistic journey.

The following pages suggest a structure for both formative and summative assessments. A 5-point scale is suggested for marking assessment in every criteria. This would enable teachers, parents and students to get clarity on how the child is progressing. The table below can be used as a reference to mark the 5-point scale. Rubrics can be developed in detail for each activity.

It is important to combine both quantitative assessment (scores


## kriti-I | Grade 6


## 6 Assessments.indd 162

or grades based on rubrics) and qualitative assessment (teacher’s observations on the child’s behaviour, interest, progress and other aspects that may not be mentioned in the rubrics).

While formative assessment is based on observations in every class, the summative assessment

162

takes one whole day to be allotted for assessment. Preparation for the assessment can include gathering and organising the space, materials, tools, instruments and _ other essential equipment. Students are to spontaneously create something on the spot, based on what is asked.
