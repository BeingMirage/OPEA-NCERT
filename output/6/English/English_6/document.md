## FOREWORD

The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pafichakoshas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8.

The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks.

Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 6 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural and geographical landscapes wherein they are sure to find traces of their lived experiences. Poorvi also weaves into its contents snippets from the vast treasure trove of Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, and embeds values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender equality, digital skills, etc. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, develop among them the core competencies in listening, speaking, reading and writing by intelligently designing various activities around them, thereby seamlessly integrating vocabulary and grammar within meaningful contexts.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

## ABOUT THE Book

Poorvi, a textbook of English for Grade 6 is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are very closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences.

The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies.

CG-1: Student develops independent reading comprehension and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles and news reports).

CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings and experiences of social events.

CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing and responding.


## CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature.

CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression.

CG-6: Develops appreciation the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language.

C-6.1: Understands the phonetics and script of the language, the number of vowels and consonants, and how they interact and are used.

C-6.2: Engages in the use of puns, rhymes, alliteration, and other wordplays in the language to make speech and writing more interesting and enjoyable.

Reprint 2025-26 . \ e


## Prelims.indd 5 18-Mar-25 1:54:15 PM

C-6.3: Becomes familiar with some of the major word games in the language (e.g., palindromes, spoonerisms, sentences without given letters or sounds, riddles, jokes, Antakshari, anagrams, crosswords, etc.)

The Curricular Goals have been covered through a variety of themes and an array of activities. There are five thematic units that comprise stories, poems, conversation, narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes such as friendship, wellness, sports, nature, art and culture, etc. have been included. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity and inclusion have been integrated in all the units. Each unit has three literary pieces— story, poem, conversation, or non-fiction. There are intext questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, etc.

Unit 1 ‘Fables and Folk Tales’ offers timeless wisdom through engaging narratives that resonate with young minds. It includes a classic fable as well as a folk tale from Tamil Nadu. The story, ‘A Bottle of Dew’ shows that true success comes from hard work and diligence. This story encourages students to value perseverance as a pathway to success. The poem, ‘The Raven and the Fox’ is a fable told in poetic form where students learn about the futility of vanity and flattery. ‘Rama to the Rescue’ is a graphic story that demonstrates the value of presence of mind in overcoming challenges.

Unit 2 ‘Friendship’ will help students comprehend the meaning of ‘real friendship’ and that friendship has a huge impact on one’s well-being. The story ‘The Unlikely Best Friends’ is a narrative of a unique friendship that blossoms between Gajaraj, the elephant and Buntee, the dog. This story highlights the importance of empathy and how true friendship can bring joy and fulfillment, even in unexpected circumstances. ‘A Friend’s Prayer’ is a poem that reflects the significance of nurturing friendships. ‘The Chair’ is a story in which a grandfather helps Mario, his grandson, to distinguish between real and superficial friends.

Unit 3 ‘Nurturing Nature’ is about the relationship between nature and human beings. The idea that nature has healing powers is inculcated among learners through the selected narratives. This unit encourages students’

curiosity to explore the world around them. ‘Neem Baha,’ is a conversation between Amber and the grand old neem tree. Through the conversation, the students learn about the numerous benefits of the neem tree found in almost all parts of our country. The poem, ‘What a Bird Thought, is an empathetic journey that the students partake when they see the world through the eyes of a little bird. ‘Spices that Heal Us’ is a letter from a grandmother about spices that are used at home and have natural healing and recovery processes. This unit upholds the rich knowledge of the herbs and spices, which has been handed down over generations.

Unit 4 ‘Sports and Wellness’ invites students to explore the multifaceted world of physical activity, mental health and _ holistic well-being. This unit aims to cultivate not only physical fitness but also emotional intelligence, self-awareness and a positive mindset, equipping students with essential skills for navigating the complexities of the new era with confidence and vitality. The story, ‘Change of Heart’ highlights the value of sportsmanship, fair play and enjoying the game regardless of winning or losing. The poem, ‘The Winner’ captures the joy and excitement of childhood games, emphasising the thrill of outdoor play. ‘Yoga—A Way of Life’ is about maintaining a healthy lifestyle, well-being and discipline.

Knowing about the WHO mYoga app also empowers the children to explore yoga in a fun and accessible way, developing physical fitness, mental clarity and emotional resilience in the formative years.

Unit 5 ‘Culture and Tradition’ aims to reawaken the spirit of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat among the students. It also celebrates the indomitable and unwavering creative spirit of our country. ‘Kalakritiyon ka Bharat,’ enables the students to be aware about the rich heritage of craftwork. Presented in the form of narratives of children from different parts of India, it promotes appreciation of various art forms. The poem, ‘The Kites’ is an autobiographical account of a kite and its invincible spirit. ‘Ila Sachani: Embroidering Dreams with her Feet’ is a tribute to the persistence of a young girl. The story on Ila Sachani with special needs introduces the learners with traditional embroidery highlighting the fact that one can overcome challenges and can achieve success beyond limits. The real-life narrative is evidence of how challenges

can be turned into opportunities with focus, hard work, positivity and never giving up. The poem, ‘National War Memorial’, is to recite and appreciate the spirit behind it.

These literary pieces are not only entertaining but also instill valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth and helping children navigate social situations with confidence. The selected pieces will resonate with children’s daily experiences and encourage positive values like resilience, empathy and emotional intelligence that can have a profound impact on their development.

The focus of the book is developing competencies of listening, speaking, reading and writing while developing vocabulary and grammar in context. Language learning becomes meaningful when connected to the immediate environment of learners and they express their thoughts, feelings, experiences through experiential learning. All the activities are colour coded under the headings—‘Let us discuss’, ‘Let us think and reflect’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us listen’, ‘Let us learn’, ‘Let us write’ and ‘Let us explore’. Transcripts for ‘Let us listen’ are given at the end of each unit. Students can listen to the audio provided in the QR code for each unit. In-text activities and exercises at the end of each chapter are engaging—they promote joyful learning along with assessment as and for learning. Illustrations have been designed depicting the context to enhance learning.

We sincerely hope that the students will enjoy doing these activities, and that these will help develop the desired and intended language competencies.

## Poorvi

The textbook of English for Grade 6 is titled Poorvi after the Indian raga ‘Poorvi’. This raga is said to promote harmony and serenity. It is associated with dusk, specifically sunset time (Sandhi Prakash). Each raga in Indian music carries its own emotional significance and is symbolically connected to certain seasons, times of day, and moods. Ragas are believed to evoke specific emotions in listeners.

Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical raga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning.

Carefully, he took the bottle to the sage. The sage smiled and muttered something over the water. Then he returned the bottle and said, “Try it out.” Rama Natha sprinkled a few drops on a copper vessel and waited for it to turn to gold. To his surprise nothing happened!

“This is cheating,” he told the sage. “I have wasted six precious years of my life.”

But sage Mahipati only smiled and called Madhumati to come forward. She came with a big box. When she opened it, inside shined stacks of gold coins!

Now the sage turned to the very surprised Rama Natha and said, “There is no magic potion that can turn things into gold. You worked hard on your land and created this plantation. While you looked after the trees, your wife sold the fruits in the market. That’s how you got this money. It was your hard work that created this wealth, not magic. If I had told you about this earlier, you would have not listened to me, so I played a trick on you.”

Rama Natha understood the wisdom behind these words and worked even harder on his plantation from that day on.

There was a boy called Mario who loved to have lots of friends. He showed off a lot, always talking about how many friends he had at school, and how he was so friendly with everyone.

One day his grandfather said to him, “Mario, I bet you a fruit chaat. You don’t have as many friends as you think you have. ’'m sure many of them are nothing more than companions or partners.”

Mario accepted the bet readily. However, he wasn’t sure how he could test whether his schoolmates were real friends or not. So, he asked his grandpa for help. He suggested, “I have exactly what you need. It’s in the attic. Wait here a minute.”

Grandpa left, soon returning as though carrying something in his hand, but Mario could see nothing there.

“Take it. It’s a very special chair. As it’s invisible, it’s rather tricky to sit on it. But if you take it to school and manage to sit on it, then

## Tue UNLIKELY BEsT FRIENDS

Let me tell you a story of acow and a leopard from Vadodara in Gujarat who became friends. As you know, a leopard is a wild animal and a cow is a domestic animal. Some people say that the cow took care of the leopard cub like a mother. When the cub became older, it went away from the village. It returned to meet the cow at night. The villagers were worried but they never stopped the leopard. They saw that the leopard just sat beside the cow quietly. The cow and leopard spent time by relaxing and playing with each other. The leopard did not like the villagers and stopped coming regularly. The villagers were surprised that the leopard never attacked the cow but became its friend.

Amber : Namaste! I am Amber. I would like to talk to you. May I?

Neem Baba : Sure, dear Amber. I know you. You played in my shade in your childhood. You may call me ‘Neem Baba’.

Amber : [have seen you almost everywhere. Please tell me something more about yourself.

Neem Baba : I am very old. I was born millions of years ago somewhere in North India or Myanmar. Soon, my family spread outside India.

Amber : Outside India? Where else can neem be found?

Neem Baba : My family can be found in many Asian and African countries and even in some parts of America.

Amber :I know that people clean their teeth with your twigs and protect clothes with your leaves. Sometime back, when my brother had measles, the doctor told us to put neem leaves on his bed and make him lie down on them. Can you explain why?

Neem Baba: The doctors know that neem leaves have chemical properties that destroy germs. Measles cause itching all over the body. Neem leaves give comfort and do not allow germs to breed. Neem leaves, bark, flowers, fruits and even roots can be used to make medicines to cure many diseases.

Oh, little Amber, you know so much. Remember, these remedies are to be used only by people who are well trained and have a lot of experience.

: Yes, I will. Tell me Neem Baba,

is there any use of neem for the farmers?

Yes. If the powder of neem seeds is mixed in water and sprayed on plants and trees, then locusts don’t eat them. If it is used in rice fields, where water remains standing, it stops mosquito breeding and helps to increase crop yield. It also saves the crop from termites, which eat roots of the crop, and it also stops breeding of other insects that eat crops.

Dear Vikram and Vaibhavi,

Namaste! Ijust got your message that you are better now.

lam happy that the natural cures that I had shared, helped you. You should try to remember these cures and may share them with your friends. When I was a child, I learnt them from my grandmother. She used to find home remedies for most of the weather-related common illnesses. Let me share some of the benefits of the spices that most of us have in our kitchen.

Let me start with haldi, which is called turmeric in English. It helps in improving our energy level and digestion. It helps in reducing body pain too.

Next, let us take methi, which is called fenugreek in English. You will be surprised to know that it helps me in keeping my sugar level and my body weight in control. I need to soak the methi seeds overnight and drink the water in the morning.

Jeera (cumin) seeds soaked in water overnight can also improve digestion and help cure sleeplessness.

You know, when you were babies and had gas in your tummy, I used to put heeng (asafoetida) water on your tummy to give you some relief. Heeng can also help in controlling cough and cold.

¢ Dalchini (cinnamon) and laung (clove) give relief when we have toothache till we can consult a dentist.

¢ Adrak (ginger) is another herb that can help us when we have cough and cold. It also gives relief from pain. Do you know, ginger has been used in cooking for more than 4000 years? Even today, it is extensively used in cooking Indian food. ,

Kali mirch (black pepper) is also helpful in digestion and can give us relief from body pain.

You may have seen that at the end of a meal, saunf (fennel seeds) and ajwain (carom seeds) are served, It is because they help in the digestion of food.

¢ Elaichi (cardamom) also helps us with digestion and respiratory troubles in addition to curing bad breath.

## Natural Cures for Cough

1. To prepare this home remedy, you just need ginger and honey. First, take , grate it and take the juice from it. Take about two teaspoons of this juice and add about two and half teaspoons of honey to it. Mix it properly. Warm slightly on very low heat for a minute. Then about three to four times a day to get relief from cough. Have patience to see the effect as natural cures with ginger and honey might take some time to show results.

2. To prepare the second for cough, take about 10 grams of each— long pepper, dried ginger and basil leaves. Add four to six small cardamoms and a fine powder. If you take this powder with an equal , it will give you relief from cough.

/(& Let us read I

Prabhat always wanted to win. His parents, teachers, and friends said that he did not know how to accept defeat. The fact was that he could not bear losing, not even at marbles. He felt so good when he won that he never wanted to give up that feeling. On the contrary, losing made him feel terrible. He thought that losing was the worst thing that could happen to anyone.

If Prabhat sensed that he would lose a game, he would not play it. He would take part only when he was sure of winning, even if the game lasted only for a minute. You could not stop him from playing the kind of games he was really good at, like badminton.

A new student joined Prabhat’s school, and his name was Surya. Surya was an excellent badminton player. Prabhat waited for the last Friday ofthe month. Last Friday was significant. This was when the coach conducted friendly matches in the games period. The teams were decided on Monday and it was no surprise when Prabhat and Surya were chosen to play a round against each other. Prabhat was given the responsibility of keeping score for their match. On one hand, Prabhat prepared for the match with great seriousness. Surya, on the other hand, seemed relaxed, not taking the things seriously at all. He walked about the

whole time, smiling and cracking jokes about all sorts of things. But on Friday, atthe badminton phenomenon: court, Surya was a real phenomenon. He won = someone who points again and again, laughing and joking all _h@s special the time. However, Surya was paying so little "tes attention to the match that Prabhat managed to change the scoreboard while his opponent was looking elsewhere.

Prabhat managed to win by cheating. He made a big thing of his win, but it did not matter to Surya.

“It’s been fun. We should play again some other time,” said Surya.

On that day, everyone was discussing their game and how Prabhat had played so well. Surprisingly, Prabhat could not sleep well that night. He had won the game but he did not feel as happy as he usually did. What was surprising was that Surya did not feel bad about losing. What was more surprising was that Prabhat saw

Surya playing basketball the next day. Surya was so hopeless at it that he could not score a basket for ten minutes. Yet, he enjoyed playing the game. His happy smile never left his face.

Prabhat kept a close watch on Surya for some days. He was great at some things, terrible at others but what was common was the enjoyment. He enjoyed everything equally. As Prabhat went on with his observation, he realised that to enjoy a game, you did not need a scoreboard to keep a tally of your scores. Neither did you have to worry about winning nor losing. You needed to enjoy the game for its own sake. What matters is trying to do well, and enjoying every moment of it.

Prabhat learnt something through the observations every day, soon realising the change in himself. He had even begun playing hide and seek, and felt sad whenever it was about to end. He also started joking while playing badminton. Soon, the other students started talking amongst themselves, “Good fun playing with Prabhat, that fellow definitely has a great sporting spirit.”

Let us discuss 1. How did Surya feel about playing? 2. What was it about Surya that Prabhat observed?

## KALAKRITIYON KA BHARAT

Namaste! You must be tired and hungry after listening to so many people. I am Sushil from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. Let me tell you a unique dish of my district. It is called gakkad bharta. First, we make gakkad from wheat dough. Then, we

make balls with that dough and roast them on high heat. To make bharta, we roast brinjals and tomatoes. Then we garnish the bharta with chopped onions, coriander, green chillis and salt. This food item is made without frying. To eat it, you simply crumble the gakkad and drizzle it with some bharta and a spoonful of ghee. Come to Jabalpur and try it!

## Ina SACHANI: EMBROIDERING DREAMS WITH HER FEET

Hello everyone! I’m here today to share some simple information about Kathiawar embroidery. This is a very old form of embroidery. It uses many bright colours and also uses many types of stitches, like the chain stitch. The embroidery is commonly seen on clothes and home decoration items. On clothes, it is seen on children’s caps, ghagra skirts and men’s traditional shirts. In this embroidery, a lot of mirror work is done by fitting small mirrors along with the stitches. Most commonly, the designs used are geometric shapes like squares and triangles. The design of flowers is also used. There is much more to share but I'll do that some other time.


## Thank you!
