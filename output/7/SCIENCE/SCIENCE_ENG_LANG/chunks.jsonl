Prior to the trip, Nihal and his classmates were given a group assignment to prepare a presentation on the uses of electricity.

Also, suggest some other ways of grouping the uses of electricity. We use electricity all the time, so let us learn something more about electricity. You have learnt earlier that electricity is generated in multiple ways—by windmills, by using wind energy, by solar panels capturing the Sun’s energy, by falling water and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric supply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via wires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity, we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like a torchlight. AX Caution— The danger signs on electric poles and other appliances warn people that electricity can be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever perform experiments with power supply at your home or school. Even electricity from portable generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or remotes, for experiments with electricity.", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}

Such changes, in which one or more new substances are formed, are called chemical changes. New substances are formed through a process called chemical reaction. In this case, carbon dioxide from the air you breathe out (exhale) reacts with lime water, and forms a new white-coloured substance (calcium carbonate) that is insoluble in water. Therefore, the liquid in the bottle appears milky. Along with this a small amount of water is also formed. This formation of a new substance indicates a chemical change.

The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised between the second century BCE-third century CE). An accurate expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water flowing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very accurate because as water levels dropped, the flow rate decreased. This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock (Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, first mentioned by Aryabhata, and then in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals.", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}
