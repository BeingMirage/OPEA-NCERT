## FOREWORD

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages an education system that is rooted in Indian ethos, and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while simultaneously preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects, and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities (touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the panchkoshas), in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages has paved the way for the progression of their learning, further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8.

At the Middle Stage, the NCF-SE 2023 aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects, namely three languages—out of which at least two languages native to India, Science, Mathematics, Social Science, Arts Education, Physical Education, Yoga and Well-being, and Vocational Education will promote their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate and interactive textbooks in different curricular areas, which will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—arole that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction, and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions—classroom arrangement, technology integration and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within, and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is committed for providing students with such high-quality textbooks. The various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, artists and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Kriti, the textbook of Arts for Grade 6 is one of these.

The contents of Kriti encompass the art forms of Visual Arts, Dance, Theatre and Music. This textbook is for the learners to explore their creativity as well as express and explore themselves. Kriti has infused in its—visuals and other components, the rich Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, values—all deeply rooted in Bharat. Inclusivity of all genders and students with special abilities is inherent to arts giving equal opportunity to all students. Making

## se sO vs

optimum use of the technology integration, QR codes have been embedded throughout, as additional learning resources.

For all practical purposes, Kriti has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals—to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of theme and content, and develop among them the core competencies at this stage as envisaged in the NCF-SE 2023 for creativity, exploration and experiences of different art forms. The sections and chapters are intelligently designed to accommodate all students in various activities, bringing out their creativity and expression. Each activity suggested here will take the students to a journey to discover more such learning resources, be it their natural surroundings, day-to-day chores or human interventions. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding, and

encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders.

At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

## ABOUT THE BOOK

Kriti, the textbook of Arts for Grade 7 is an effort to deepen your understanding of the diverse art forms of India. This initiative will broaden your perspective, and foster an appreciation for the countless expressions of creativity and culture, spread across different regions in art forms like Music, Dance, Theatre and Visual Arts. Having explored and practiced various art forms since Grade 3 you are now aware that you are surrounded by a vibrant artistic world in your country. Every expression is unique, born from an idea or theme inspired by everyday happenings. These themes capture the essence of nature’s beauty, the diverse tasks of people, human emotions like love, tolerance, empathy, conflict and innovation, as well as problem solving elements that shape the fabric of human life. Each expression reflects deep thoughts, layered analysis and independent engagement, making it a distinctive manifestation of individual cognitive understanding and creativity.

The art forms practised in India express the daily happenings of respective communities who form the society, reflects on the gharana or parampara of traditions passed down from one generation to the other in communities, which when documented is a great story of historical evolution and contemporary practices. Taking a few examples in Music the jaatis and gramas evolved to ragas, geetis, dhruvapada, khyal, thumri, etc. In the historical evolution of dance the nritta, nritya and natya evolved to classical dances and folk dances. Similarly warli, madhubani, aipan, etc., in visual art or togalu gombeyaata,

jaatra, yakshagana in theatre reveals the wondrous expressions that collectively lead to the creation of something truly aesthetic, which builds the canvas of the society frame by frame. The Navarasas —the nine fundamental human emotions—serve as powerful channels to convey countless thoughts in an artistic and profoundly aesthetic manner.

The Indian knowledge system is embedded with gems from the artistic world. The underlying idea behind the publication of textbooks in Arts is to rejuvenate stakeholders in education, helping them understand the existing knowledge base in different areas of art. It further aims towards perspectives to make the Indian Arts valuable to the ever emerging trends in the world through creativity, innovation and continuous progress or evolution. It is always valuable to connect past values, traditions, and artistic endeavours with the present, paving the way for continuous evolution and growth toward the future. Appreciation of whatever is existing complements the skill development and contributes to building proficiency.

The present textbook has been designed in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and according to the curricular goals, competencies and learning outcomes laid out in the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 for Arts Education. The book covers multifaceted areas in Visual Arts, Music, Dance, Theatre. The basic elements that shapes the art forms and gives it the definite base have been discussed in accordance with your

age-appropriate needs and engaging activities for easy and enjoyable comprehension. The content in the textbook will help you to understand the close connection between outstanding expression of artists, their accomplishments and the events of everyday life, as well as the world we live in. This will definitely inspire you to explore different techniques and styles, and even create your own. Each of the activity has been designed to give a unique experience for you. The beauty of art is that the underlying emotion has a lot of similarities in varied forms of art. So, it can connect to people of varied interests and tastes yet each one can find their unique connection to the arts. Apart from the exercises, activities and information given in this book, there are examples of many practical and creative ideas, that can be accessed by scanning the QR codes.

Kriti, has four sections—


## || || for Theatre || | for Music


## || || for Dance and Movement


## || || for Visual Arts

Here’s how the textbook wishes to approach different concepts.


## THEATRE

Theatre for the energetic students of Grade 7 brings in equal amounts of fun along with interesting learning of facts and self exploration. From going into the depths of understanding emotions to exploring new art forms like pantomime, they have a whole new world ahead of them. But each chapter is planned

in a way where they not only learn a theatre-related element, but also acquire a new skill that enables them to handle the challenging situations that life throws at them.

“In the first chapter, they learn empathy and acceptance of others’ feelings.

“| The second chapter introduces them to a unique art of Mime! This helps in building non-verbal communication enabling better public interactions.

“The third chapter builds management and organisational skills through the knowledge of backstage work.

‘» The fourth chapter introduces them to the art of storytelling and its rich history in India.

The notes S RG M PD N has unimaginable creative avenues. The patterns which are woven through the ascending and descending notes give us music, in all forms and genres. In Grade 6, different forms and their styles of presentation in different contexts, connecting people to nature, human emotions, iconic artists, impact of musical instruments and voices, the systems of raga and tala, etc., formed the basis of understanding music, a unique intangible art form. Holistically the content in Grade 6 tried to help you explore the intricate nuances of nada or sound. The Grade 7 textbook takes you on another interesting and erudite journey in music. It lays emphasis on analysis of compositions to comprehend impact of male and female voices, the layers found in different formats of music, tempo, mood, importance of solo and group presentations, synergy between

01-May-25 1:50:31 PM

multiple musicians where harmony, rhythm, and dynamics take on a richer, more complex form; music and emotions through examples of different genres of music like shabad, musical narratives or storytelling, classical music and folk music, reforms and messages in society through, role of woman, role of inclusivity, presentation methods and skills, etc. Nuances of both Hindustani and Carnatic Music that includes ragas, their elements, compositions, different talas and the historical development. In essence, music is much more than just a sequence of notes. It is a form of expression that touches the soul, telling stories, evoking emotions, and connecting to other art forms, a rich tapestry of cultural and emotional expression.


## DANCE AND MOVEMENT

This section and the Grade 7 will be focussing on—

“» | Movements of various parts of the body in continuation of what they have done in Grade 6.

“Learning about the interrelationship of the arts, especially looking at sculpture and geometrical shapes.

“Learning some basic units of dance with steps, jumps and pirouettes becoming comfortable with their body.

“Comfort level in emotional expressions and connecting them with nature.

“Creativity with dance movements and hand gestures, and contemporary thought process in dance and movement. Discussion on how these dances convey stories, emotions, and spiritual themes.


## Vil


## “Gender sensitisation with role-playing regardless of gender.

“Explore the diversity of Indian dance forms, such as Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Odissi, and regional folk dances and research about notable dance personalities.

“Importance of team effort and collaborations, and holistic development through dance and movement.

“Observation of dance gestures (mudras) and creating short dance sequences.


## VISUAL ARTS

In Grade 6, your attention was focussed on observing nature, people, different types of daily use objects, art traditions and techniques with their multidimensional aspects. Through line, shape, form, colour, value, texture and space, you will have the scope to express in multifarious ways. Similarly, in Grade 7 to understand the concepts better, you will be introduce to a wide range of visual arts’ practices that include drawing, painting, design and heritage crafts interspersed with art history. A tiny grass, leaf, stone, cloth, historical monument, utensils in the kitchen, the room where you live or your classroom has so much variety in terms of shape, surface, colour, dimensions, etc. You simply find all these observations and understanding, exotic through gradual discovery. Your expression through sketches, colour, clay, paper folding, etc, makes your engagement interesting, sharpens your mind, and gives you better skills and ideas to express non-verbally culminating to inner joy, and fulfilment in your experience. The chapters also reveal fascinating connections that integrate the visual arts

with theatre, music, dance, science, mathematics, history and various other disciplines. The insights and skills gained through the Visual Arts would help every student communicate their feelings, and ideas in uniquely creative and powerful ways in all aspects of their education, and life.

Still life of objects depicted as icons and symbols, study of colour through the colour wheel, and exercises for colour mixing and matching, theme of portraiture to pay attention to basic ratios and proportions of the human head along with depiction of facial expressions, relief sculpture as examples of art history, exploration of local arts and traditions through textiles and embroidery from different regions and the art of calligraphy, which explore letters, scripts and written words in artistic ways are the different themes in this textbook. This journey in visual arts will not only enhance your creativity but also provides a unique way to express yourself beyond words.


## INTEGRATION OF ALL ART FORMS WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES

“» CULTURAL AWARENESS: Students learn to value the artistic traditions that form the backbone of India’s cultural identity.

“CREATIVITY AND EXPRESSION: Opportunities to experiment with art forms, and encourage individual expression and creativity.

INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING: Links with history, geography, and literature deepen their understanding of the arts in a broader context.

CONNECTION TO HERITAGE: By studying these art forms, students feel a sense of pride and connection to their cultural roots.

This approach ensures that Kriti not only educates but also inspires students to engage with and celebrate the incredible artistic legacy of India. It will be interesting to see how activities in each art form integrate with other disciplines like Science, Mathematics, Language, and Social Science, offering a holistic approach to education. Enjoy exploring the diverse facets of art in Grade 7.

## TIME ALLOCATION AND ASSESSMENTS

Under the Illustrative Timetable of the NCF-SE, Arts has been allocated 4 periods during the week and 1 period on Saturday. The document also suggests the use of block periods, where two periods (40 minutes) are combined to make enough time for activity-based classes. This would give a continuous stretch of time (80 minutes, ie., 1 hr 20

The Arts textbook contains four sections, each dealing with a separate art form. It is important to plan the timetable in a way that distributes the learning of all art forms equally across the year.

As per the NCF-SE 2023, the time allocated for Arts for the entire academic year is — 100 hours (or 150 periods of 40

Based on these options the four art forms could be allocated the four periods on weekdays, and Saturday could It is preferable to have all four art forms distributed be used for activities that are interdisciplinary or for taking across the week as the progress of all sections would happen simultaneously. It is better to avoid a system where one art form is taken up after the full completion of the other.

progressing simultaneously as it would enable the children to understand the inter-connections between the art forms in order to get a holistic understanding.


## ASSESSMENT

Assessments in Arts play a crucial role in understanding and nurturing students’ creative abilities and artistic growth. Unlike other subjects, Arts assessments focus on evaluating a wide range of skills, including creativity, critical thinking, technical proficiency and expressive capabilities. These assessments are designed not only to measure progress and mastery but also to encourage exploration, self-expression, and a deeper appreciation for the arts.


## METHODS OF ASSESSMENTS

As the assessment processes are primarily skill-based, it is not dependent on the ‘correct or wrong answer’ given by the students. It is, therefore, important not to structure ‘tests’ with question papers and written answers. This would entirely defeat the purpose of the approach used in the Arts curriculum. A variety of assessment methods such as portfolios, performance reviews, project-based evaluations and reflective self-assessments, can give insights into each student’s unique artistic journey.


## FORMATIVE AND SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENTS


## oe

» Formative assessment is based on observations in every class and the performance of the child in each activity. Rubrics provided at the end of each chapter help in structuring the scores/grades through the year.

“» Summative assessmentis to have a separate day allotted for assessment. Activities conducted in class during the year and its variations can be used to assess the understanding, and ability of the student in the skills and competencies. Examples are given at the end of each section to enable better planning. Whatever is suggested spontaneous creation by students is the merit to be rewarded.


## GRADES AND SCORES

Since, the arts is about creativity, visualisation, expression and imagination, it cannot have correct or wrong answers. Scoring here, is, therefore, based on parameters of the level of skill acquired and the competencies acquired by the child. The


## 0_Prelims.indd 16

teacher is to be completely familiar with the competencies and learning outcomes for each activity in order to have a fair assessment through scores.

A 5-point scale is suggested for marking in every criterion. This would enable teachers, parents and students to get clarity on how the child is progressing. The table below can be used as a reference to mark the 5-point scale in the rubrics that are provided after each chapter.

It is important to combine both quantitative assessment (scores or grades based on rubrics) and qualitative assessment (teacher’s observations on the child’s behaviour, interest, progress and other aspects that may not be mentioned in the rubrics).

Dear Theatre Teacher,

As we work together to build the spirit of theatre in children—with creativity, fun and joy on the one hand, and hard work, rigour and discipline on the other—here is a note that intends to share the vision of this textbook with you.

The theatre section for Grade 7 has been written to take the children to the next level of understanding from Grade 6. It blends numerous activities, along with the theoretical knowledge of the concepts introduced. While they get foundational knowledge and the historical understanding in the text, the activities included in it enhances their confidence and skills. Here are some requirements to ensure theatre classes are fruitful and enjoyable.


## FREE SPACE TO WORK

The primary requirement of the children is to move around freely as they do their activities. It is, therefore, important to have a free space where children explore the possibilities and try various activities without hinderance.


## CONNECT TO REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS

The content in this book aims to make learning

relevant to their everyday lives. From building empathy and acceptance through emotions, to enhancing discipline, planning and management skills through backstage activities — theatre can have a role to play in everyone’s lives. As a teacher, if such references are brought up in classroom discussions, it would make the lessons much more fruitful.


## ASSESSMENT

This is a crucial part of the entire process of studying theatre in school as a mainstream subject. Though it is important to have marks or grades like every subject, it is essential to keep the spirit of theatre intact and not reduce it to a mere pen-paper exam with a question paper. The final outcome or presentation is not the only benchmark. The efforts, thoughts and processes behind it also need to be considered along with this—


## Knowledge application


## Effort and participation


## Creativity and presentation


## Team work and collaboration

Read _ the


## section on time allocation and


## assessments at the beginning of the book for better

clarity. Assessment for theatre has been planned in different levels as mentioned below.


## FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT

This is to be done in class after completing the activities and chapters at two levels:

Circle Time—A process followed after every class and every activity. The teacher sits with the students in an informal setting (to get honest responses from children) to ask questions about what they did. They share their thoughts and experiences, based on = “» Share move examples which the teacher makes of pictures, paintings or : other instances where notes about each child. you have seen emotions. Some questions are given * Ifyouwere given the ; work of creating such a in the textbook. The temple, how would you prepare for it? teacher can explore more > 14 , * How much time would

questions based on the you spend practising it? Can you apply it to your response of class. work in school?

Brain Booster — Practical activities have been provided for the children to try what they have

learnt in the chapter. The outcome of these could be used to assess the children and fill in the rubrics provided. Outcome of each activity is not about how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the final product is, rather, about whether

the process has been understood well and the skills are well-developed.

Rubrics —Upon the completion of each chapter, a rubric has been given with the desired learning outcomes that the teacher can mark. The children are also asked to give grades to themselves, based on their perception of their performance in that chapter. This self analysis can also act as feedback for the teacher.


## SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT

This will be an activity based test conducted at the end of the year. The activities need to be a combination of the lessons learnt during the year. The assessment is conducted at individual and group level to assess different skills and competencies. A sample set of activities has been given at the end of the section.

Emotions have always played a very important role in our lives. Since time immemorial, we have tried to understand the depth of what, why and how emotions exist in our lives.

As this Sanskrit line from Bharata’s Natyashastra says—

Va Wasa Aaa Aes VAT: " Vande Seid a sea falgaarAary 11 125 11


## Evam Rasasca Bhavasca Natake Smrtah Ya Evametan Janati Sa Gacchet Siddhimuttamam

—Natyashastra, Bharata Muni (Ch. VID } In the performance of a play, feelings, sentiments, mood,

thoughts and state of mind need to be created. Only when one knows this well, the play will attain success.

Emotions in different intensities. Lokadharmi and Natyadharmi—realistic and stylised. Representation in ancient architecture.

In the previous year, we discussed about the concept of—

It implies emotions are the most important thing to connect not just for the audience, but people in general. It is, therefore, crucial to understand how emotions work in order to make the right connections and live a positive life. Let us do a quick recap of what we have learnt so far.


## “: Bhava—The inherent attitude and state of mind of the individual.

## RS te


## Mask-making — Emoting through masks.

Based on the concepts we already discussed, we shall now go deeper into understanding and expressing emotions. As we have already learnt, Bharata Muni researched and analysed to conclude that there are eight predominant emotional experiences, and the ninth was added later making it the Navarasa. With our own little research and understanding, we can add to this knowledge. Sounds exciting?

To start with, let us pick one Rasa.

Now, list (or draw) different levels of that Rasa (emotion)


## KRITI

Here is an example to demonstrate this—

RASA— ROUDRA (ANGER)


## DIFFERENT LEVELS


## Mild Anger Very Angry Rage


## oS

Here we are looking


## at different levels


## of intensity of

each emotion. To understand this better, let us play a game

that will let you think about each emotion, as you have fun with your friends.

Intensity is the measurable quality or degree of a property or condition.


## ACTIVITY 1.1: EMOTIONAL CORNERS

Every corner of the room is assigned different emotions and anyone who stands in that corner has to express that emotion—in speech, facial expression and body language. Placards or posters are placed at different places to identify emotions. It starts with all children standing at the centre of the room. Play a trial round to understand better.


## TRIAL ROUND

The placards are placed in the room as shown. Children shall stand in the centre, ready to start.


## BIBHATSA (Disgust)


## ADBHUTA (Surprised)

= o Su Loma} @ 26 $b =8 o < @ &


## VEERA (Heroic, courage)


## INSTRUCTIONS

Each of you take turns to go to an emotion of your choice, say one or two lines that depict the feeling and act it out as well.


## EXAMPLE

One child chooses veera. Stands in its place. Depicts it in voice, expression and action. The next child chooses a different emotion, stands in its place, depicts it in voice, expression and action, and so on.

Now we come to the actual part!

Since, we are all familiar with the various emotions, let us start working on specific details of each emotion. Just like the example given on page 6—where anger has been shown in three levels—pick another emotion, discuss in class about its various levels and make placards accordingly. You can even add a fourth level if you can identify it. Here is another example—


## EMOTION: HAPPINESS


## LEVELS

1. Immediate gratification (you get to eat your favourite ice cream).

2. Personal achievement (you won a prize ina difficult competition).

3. Help and connection (you help your friend with notes as he was ill).

4. Ultimate good (you donate books and clothes to a nearby orphanage).


## Now, with new names to the corners, everyone can

stand in the centre and play the game using speech, action and expression. Repeat the same for each emotion.

You can try doing it without voice. It will help in focusing on expression and body language. You can skip action to focus only on voice and expression. All variations with all emotions can be explored in class.


## 8 | KRITI

Note to the Teacher: It is important to have a discussion among the children regarding the levels of each emotion. The children have to think and arrive at different levels each time. It may not be the same for every batch or class. Each group of children can arrive at different names and levels. There is no correct or wrong answer here.

iy The teacher is advised not to give the names of variable intensities to children, but only help and

4, support them in arriving at the final names 7 of levels.


## ADVANCED

Now that you all have mastered the names and varying intensities of each emotion, let’s try putting it in the form of a story. Now, the corners will only have names of levels. It could be the level of any emotion depending on the situation of the story.

Example: Once upon a time there was a queen who ruled over a huge province in India. She fought many battles and protected her people bravely (calls out Veera rasa, L3. The rest of the children go to

L3 and emote it). One day, two children came to her and said they can defeat her easily (calls out — Adbhuta rasa, L2. The children go to L2 and emote it). She laughs and agrees to the challenge (Hasya rasa, L1).

And so, it goes on. Everyone can take turns in narrating stories. They can either be given time to prepare or have them say it spontaneously. They can also narrate popular stories of the Panchatantra or Puranas.

Note to the Teacher: It is highly beneficial to ask each child to write the three or four levels of emotion as they perceive. Each child would have their own experience that would determine this. It is important to have every child think on their own (for better self-awareness) and actively participate in the group (for peer validation). Emphasising the importance of voice and volume to convey emotions will help in better communication, and enable children with

visual impairment to connect better.


## Re 9 | UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS ADSEE


## CIRCLE TIME

How many new additions did you make to Bharata Muni's list of emotions?

Do you think you

can have more than three or four levels of intensity?

What are those emotions?

Do you actually feel or experience the emotion and its intensities as you express them? Or is it just external?


## ND EXPLORING EXPRESSION STYLES

As you played the game of Emotional Corners, did you notice how each one of you had a different way of showing the emotion? Though the situation and feeling was the same, why is it that some people close their eyes when they are scared and others open their eyes wide in the same fear?

List a few other examples where you think the same emotion was shown in very different ways in the table in the next column.

Add more lines if you need to write about more emotions or styles. But it is important to observe others intently, before doing this exercise. You can also include actions (body language) and sound (voice) under styles.

## ND STYLES OF ACTING

Acting has been explored by many experts and artists, across the world for many centuries. The style of performance usually depends on their local culture. But there are few styles that go beyond this and are universally followed, even to this day. Some of the ancient cultures that created their own styles are mentioned on the right.


## Some parts

In the pictures on the right, do you see the variety in of India >

the styles of presentation? Each one looks completely different from the other. You see variety in costume, properties, music, dialogues and even the kind of stories they tell. With so much variety, how do we find styles that can be applied universally, no matter where it is performed? This is achieved by creating styles that are more natural and closer to real life. Brecht style and method acting are some examples.

Now, look at the these pictures and try to identify the country or the culture. It is difficult, right? It could be any part of the world, but mostly set in the present context. So, these styles are very different when compared to the previous set of culture-based style. These styles are based on techniques of acting and direction that can be applied to any script or story. You will learn in detail about these styles in the upcoming grades.


## Method Acting >

As we have observed, there are two major styles of


## acting:

1.

With elaborate costumes, make up and music, dramatic acting, bigger gestures and loud voices.

Costumes and make up that are close to everyday life, minimal music, actors in their normal behaviour.

Do we have names for these? Who gave them their


## names?

As we studied in Grade 6, more than 2500 years

ago, Bharata Muni, a great sage from India studied, researched and analysed the performing arts and defined all these elements. Though it was written 2500


## 12 | KRITI

years ago we still use it today as it is still relevant!

The level of detail and expertise in his work Natyashastra is astonishing.

The two styles as defined by Bharata Muni are Natya Dharmi and Loka Dharmi.

NATYA DHARMI — bigger, exaggerated movement, over-the-top expressions, loud voice, elaborate bright costume and make up, lots of jewellery, and accessories

LOKA DHARMI — perform like in real life. Actions, expressions, costume are all natural and resemble reality. It appears like the situation is naturally happening on stage and not acting.

Identify Which of These is Natural (Loka Dharmi) and Which of These is Exaggerated (Natya Dharmi)

Here is’ the actual stanza from the Natyashastra that talks about natural and stylised acting.

| ACTIVITY 1.2: PICK YOUR STYLE! | 1.2: PICK YOUR STYLE!

This activity is done in order to get familiar with the two styles of acting. Keep a few chits prepared with simple actions written on each one.


## Meaning: Practice

## o %

What are the differences observed in both styles of acting?

“» Which method is more effective? Why?

Example: Walking on the road with many potholes, taking a gift out of the bag, eating your favourite chocolate.


## BASIC

A set of folded chits are kept on a table. Each child picks up one chit. Reads the action written on it. The child gets to choose if it wants to do the action in a natural style or stylised. All children get a chance to try realistic acting, stylised acting or both!


## ADVANCED

Another set of chits is kept alongside this set of actions. It has ‘realistic’, ‘stylised’ and ‘both’ written in them. The children pick one chit each from the two bundles and follow what is written. They can try multiple times with different combinations each time.

» Share examples of where you have seen stylised acting (movies, TV, etc.).


## 14 | KRITI

As we discuss the representation of stylised art forms, the first thing that comes to one’s mind is the rich and beautiful sculptures and carvings we see on the walls of ancient buildings, including temples. Can you recall some of the artistic carvings that you have seen recently?

Name of the building _________--------- eee Location ___________-_-------------- ee

Name one unique thing you remember about the art works

This brings us to the next part of exploring emotions.


## ANCIENT ARCHITECTURE

The uniqueness of Indian culture is that — though such heritage sculptures are ancient, but they are still relevant and apply to everyday life.

Indian architecture, with its breathtaking sculptures, serves as a timeless gallery of human emotion, depicting the essence of Navarasas in stone. Every part of the country has these sculptures in different styles that also represent the dynasty and its history. Each building, temple and sculpture has a unique story to tell. The sculptures depicting emotions have stories that have more emotions hidden within them. Here are some of them.

fA” & 1 des ae ted nord ws wy gr

A sculpture of a young boy—Sala, fighting a lion. What emotion does it evoke? Bravery and courage, Veera rasa.

This is from the Chennakeshava Temple, Belur, Karnataka. The Hoysla dynasty that ruled the place got the name from this—Hoy-Sala, meaning, kill the lion, Sala! (1006-1346 CE).

RS. A sculpture of Dvarapalaka (guardian ; > of the entrance). The emotion it : evokes — fear. Does it not look scary?

This sculpture in Bhayanaka rasa is

_ meant to scare off the negative ) forces.

You can see more such sculptures at the Brihadeeshwara temple, Tanjavur, Tamil Nadu. This > was built by the Chola Dynasty

) (815-1280 CE).

No binding agents such as cement or soil were used to keep the stones of the temple together. It does * not even have the conventional foundation under the ground, like most modern buildings. Yet, not only is this temple one of the tallest of its kind, it has also stood strong against earthquakes and storms for over a 1000 years!

This is an interesting sculpture with three emotions in one. This is the Trimurti in the Elephanta Caves in Maharashtra. It has three faces of Shiva, each depicting a different emotion and a meaning—creation, sustenance and destruction. This was built during the Rashtrakuta Dynasty (755-975 CE).


## 16 | KRITI

IED DEDICATION OF A LIFETIME!

Find a picture of a temple sculpture that you have seen and paste it in the box below. Write about the emotion in the sculpture and the story behind it.

If you notice the time period, all these sculptures that are artistically perfect have survived for hundreds of years, while today’s buildings might not last a few decades. What is the difference? The time and effort put by every individual artist involved in making these sculptures was wholehearted, as they believed this was God’s work. Even a minor scratch or a glitch was considered bad as nothing could go wrong in God’s work. That was the level of dedication. It was never considered as just a ‘job’ for which a salary was paid, as it is the case today.

Here is an interesting story that tells us about the level of dedication the artists had. It is believed to be true.

Master craftsman Jakanachari, was ordered by the Hoysala King, Nripa Haya to build a grand temple. His dedication to work was such that he left home and immersed himself in making sculptures. It is said that he chose each stone after a blessing from God. He had stayed away from home for so many years that he didn’t know anything about his family. One day, a young artist joined his team and immediately spotted a major flaw in one of the stone statues. A

flaw by Jakanachart was unheard of as he was a perfectionist. But a test was conducted and a cavity was found in the navel part of the sculpture, where a frog was living! This was a huge blow on the great artist’s work. As promised, he cut off his hands as he considered himself incapable of the God’s work he was assigned. It was later discovered that the young boy was none other than the artist’s son Dankandchari! Hearing this, Jakanachari felt proud and thankful for such a blessing of a dedicated expert son. He later took over to complete the temple work. It is also said that God blessed him to regain his hands and the father-son duo completed the temple in Belur, Karnataka. We still look up to these works in awe. Do you think any of today’s buildings match the kind of detailing and artistic work done in those days?

It was all possible only through the dedication, commitment and persistence of thousands of artists.

## /2| SPEECH— MIME

“Mime as an art form speaks the universal language of silence. It can make the invisible become visible and make silence the most powerful and loudest form of communication.”


## — Marcel Marceau (a well-known French mime artist)


## YOU WILL LEARN

“> What is mime?

“> Basic features of mime. * Advantages of mime. “> Preparing for a show.

Imagine a situation where you are at an important event and nobody is allowed to talk. You suddenly remember that you had kept your umbrella outside as you were waiting for your friend, before the event began. But forgot to bring it inside with you. You are in the middle of the hall and cannot walk outside. You have to tell your friend sitting near the entrance door to go out and bring it in for you. How would you communicate it?

Sit in pairs in the class and communicate this to each other. You can take turns doing this. If possible, you can also continue the conversation, for example, the friend replies by saying it is not possible to walk out. You request again, saying it is important—and so on. But all in silence!

What did you just do? Communicate using actions and expressions. Right? You just did a mime bit, that was miming!

Called Mukaabhinaya in India, let us first get familiar with the words used in this form of performance.

Here are some basic terms that you might be familiar with.


## Facial Expression The emotion and

reaction shown on the face

Body Language Hand gestures, body postures and actions made

Energy Intensity and focus behind each action


## S


## TECHNIQUE-BASED TERMS

Mime: A form of acting that uses no words or sound. Could be a part of a bigger play with dialogues.

The person performing this is also called a ‘mime’.

Pantomime: A theatrical performance that involves multiple actors and music. The show involves acting, mostly in comedy.

Interactive: Incorporating audience participation to make them ‘a part of the illusion’ for more impact.

So let us jump right in and try doing some mime.

Since mime is all about performing without using a specific set or props, first you have to learn how to create an imaginary world and convince the audience of its existence. Think of an object that you use every day, say your pencil box. Now pretend you are holding it in your hand. You have to remember the size and shape ofit as you ‘mime’ its presence in your hand. Now, try and enact how you would hold the pencil box as if it is filled with iron (same size and shape). Now, imagine it is fully empty. How would you show these changes? Try different options to experience an object without touching it.

Now, before we actually begin mime work, here are some hasic tips to help you.

1. DO NOT BECOME THE OBJECT, USE THE OBJECT

This is a common mistake made while showing an object. You have to show how you hold the object and not make your hand into the object. Here are some examples—


## SCISSORS


## SHOW A PAIR OF | HOLDING A GUN


## WRONG CORRECT WRONG

If you just pointed two fingers and moved them like a pair of scissors moved, then it is a mistake. If we can modify our fingers to create a gun, then how would we show a larger object? Say, a train or a car or a fridge? Hence, the first rule of mime is to use the object.

2. ESTABLISH THE SPACE (SIZE) AND WEIGHT OF THE OBJECT

To make imaginary objects more believable, a mime has to ensure that the actions are in line with the quality of object they are handling. A cricket ball, a_ basketball, a balloon— the size, weight and the experience of each one is very different from the other.

Try doing actions of holding each one separately. With this in mind, let us play a fun game to learn this better.

ACTIVITY 2.2: TEAM ACTIVITY (FULL CLASS)

All of you sit in a circle. One of you volunteers to start with an imaginary object. The first person imagines an object, does an action to clearly depict it in terms of its shape, size and weight. The object is then passed on to the next one. Next person receives it, does another action to add to the understanding of the object and passes it on.

Nobody can use sound or speech. Nobody must announce the name of the object. It is upto the understanding of the students and each one’s ability to communicate.

Basic—Everyday objects like pen, a pair of scissors or a watch can be shown. When the object is received, each one of you does a unique action that is not done before and then passes it on.

Advanced — This also has everyone passing the object. But the object changes slightly with time. So, the action done by the first person would not be the same for the last person. For example, a huge ice cube (melts with time) or a handful of sand (keeps reducing in quantity as it slips through the fingers).


## CIRCLE TIME

What is the most enjoyable aspect of performing without speech or props?

What is most difficult about performing mime? No use of speech or no use of props?


## WD THREE PILLARS OF


## A MIME SHOW

Any successful mime show must have the following three aspects. Remember, all these have to be practiced both individually and as a group.

1. IMAGINATION

For a mime show, along with working on your body language and expressions, the most crucial one is imagination. While the first two are entirely about the performer and their effort, imagination involves both performer and the audience.

Unless the audience participates in the imagination of the objects, situations and the environment of the story, it cannot be a successful show. This ‘give and take’ between the audience and actor— making the show unique and enjoyable—is facilitated by imagination!

2. EXAGGERATION

This is the technique of making movement, actions and expressions larger than life. Since mime relies on _ silent communication, it becomes important to ensure subtle details are visible and understood. This

is specifically important when performances are held for a large audience. This is similar to the Natyadharmi style of acting, from Chapter 1, which includes dramatic and stylised techniques like slow motion, repetition, and over expression to bring about this impact.

3. COSTUME AND MAKE UP

Unlike drama or dance, costume and make up in mime do not directly depict the character. It is primarily neutral, with subtle differences to show variation in character.

Costume—shirt and pant is fully black (if the backdrop is white) or a mix of black and white in the form of stripes on shirt or accessories like gloves, socks or suspenders.

Make up—highlighted facial features with contrasting colours of white, black and red is the main feature of make up. This is to ensure good visibility and exaggeration of expressions.

Character—specific indications are


## present in make up.


## subtly


## MIME — A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE FOR EQUALITY

The most striking quality of mime is—no speech. This breaks all barriers of language across the world. Emotions are universal. So the situations depicted in mime from any state in the country or any country in the world are understood by any person from any corner of the world. Is it not amazing?

The next quality that stands out in mime is—black and white costumes, and a common white make up for all. This has a powerful quality of eliminating the bias that comes with stereotypes of people based on the clothes they wear. It is pure story telling by

people who could be from any society, from any part of the world. It can even break gender stereotypes, for example, a scene with mining underground or building construction could have women carrying loads of weight, as the costume they wear is the same in mime.

Mime is also used as a powerful tool to help people come out of their trauma or get over bad experiences, as it gives them the freedom to express and share without the fear of being judged.


## A pantomime performance


## ACTIVITY 2.3: GROUP MIME

The class is divided into groups of 5-10. You will be given a scene to enact. You can use all the properties and sets that are necessary for the scene. Enact it like a regular play by your group.

Now, your team has to mark the set placements in your minds and remove the chairs, tables, etc. You now enact the whole scene without any sets. The props (held in your hand like walking stick, bow and arrow, etc.) can still be used. Once you are familiar with the sets, the props are also removed. Enact the whole scene without any sets or props.

Practise—perform your daily routine from when you wake up in the morning till you get to bed at night, in mime. Try and remember the minor details and depict it in your actions.

Music—you can have background music to suit the situation of your act. But make sure it is instrumental music with no lyrics or speech.

Note to the Teacher: The scene they pick for enactment can be their own creation or any familiar scene. Encourage the groups to come up with scenes

## Teacher's Comments and Student's Observations

1. BACKSTAGE WORK — THE INVISIBLE PILLAR OF THEATRE

A tree in full bloom with flowers and fruits is such a beautiful sight to watch!

But what is the source of its beauty? Its strong and healthy roots.

A beautifully constructed ancient temple that tells us many stories of the past, is a matter of pride. What is its strength?

Its strong and deep underground foundation. What do you understand from these examples?

Anything that is interesting, meaningful and successful to the people, needs a strong support system.

This is the work of backstage crew for any performance. It is a team of people who take up different responsibilities and work hard to ensure

the performance runs smoothly, without any glitches. While most people think that theatre is mainly about acting on stage, it is a lesser-known fact that those working backstage are equally, if not more important.

With so much importance being given to backstage work, you must be wondering, what is backstage? Is it the physical space that extends behind the performing area? Why is it so important?

It is important not because of the physical space, but because of the work that happens and the people involved. Notice all the effort and hard work of the backstage team as the actors perform on stage.

Backstage work involves the following aspects —

## SET AND PROPERTIES

Changing the stage set according to the scenes being performed.

Keeping all the hand props ready for the actors to pick up.

Making sure the stage is free of objects that may obstruct the actors. Support during the scene, in case something goes wrong or something is forgotten by the actor.


## COSTUME AND MAKE UP

Getting the actors ready with character related costume and make up.

Helping with quick changes between scenes.


## Support with minor tear and damage in costumes.


## 32 | KRITI

3. MUSIC

“> Working with the actors and tech team to get the right cues for sound tracks.

“> Working on music and sound effects that suit the performance.


## “> Sometimes cover-up onstage glitches with appropriate sound or music.

4. LIGHTING “Plan lights and know your cues well.

Timing lights and supporting the actors during unexpected issues.

If you noticed, all the above points are about things done during the show. Though the major backstage responsibility is during the show, there is a lot of planning and preparation that happens before and after the show. Planning after the show? Yes! Read on...


## BEFORE THE SHOW SET AND PROPERTIES

Making the required set or backdrop Borrowing, renting or purchasing properties Marking the exact position of placement Practice quick change during black out (lights are off only for 30 seconds between scenes)


## COSTUME AND MAKE UP

Design as per the character (you learnt


## it in Grade 6)

Procure, rent or make costumes for all

Plan requirement of wigs or other stylisation Costume rehearsal will help plan better


## MUSIC

= Check for mics, speakers and sound mixers = Music instruments to be tuned


## LIGHTS

= Plan the light design during rehearsals = Rig lights and mark exact positions for actors


## AFTER THE SHOW


## SET AND PROPERTIES

Dismantle the set and pack it cautiously without any damage

Transport it to a storage area

Identify issues and rectify for the next show Return the borrowed or rented properties


## COSTUME AND MAKE UP

Clothes and jewellery to be collected from actors Check for damage or missing ones


## Arrange for repair or replacement

Return borrowed or rented material


## Wash and iron costumes for the next show


## MUSIC

Safely pack all instruments and equipment Wires, ports, plugs and other equipment to be stored safely


## LIGHTS

Separate the team equipment from the venue’s Transport the lights, cables and stands back safely

With the above understanding of the kind of work that happens backstage, how many people do you think are required for each department? And how many people would be working backstage for a play that may have about 8-10 actors? At least 15-18 people! (sometimes more).


## PLANNING, MANAGEMENT AND DISCIPLINE

There are many life skills that can be acquired by doing theatre and more specifically backstage work.

## TEAM WORK AND LEADERSHIP

All departments to work in coordination and mutual understanding with each other. A problem with one could affect the whole show.


## HUMAN RESOURCE

Having the right kind of people to take up different responsibilities is of prime importance. Ensuring all are comfortable in their work also helps in maintaining high quality of work.


## TIME MANAGEMENT

This is a must for every member—be it actors or backstage. It is spoken of in detail in the section given in the next page.


## 34 | KRITI

With so many people and teams working together for one show, what would be the most important aspect to make sure all of it functions well?


## On


## ih


## COMMUNICATION

Constant sharing of ideas and issues between teams is crucial for a show. If one team is unaware of what the other team is facing, coordination would be affected which would in turn affect the performance.


## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Making sure the materials for making set, props and costumes are procured on time, ensuring they are stored safely and keeping a check on finances and budget.


## SALES AND MARKETING

With all the hard work being put in by the teams, is it not important to have a good audience to watch it?


## DISCIPLINE AND COMMITMENT

This is a quality that every member has to develop to

be able to successfully perform as a team. Qualities


## like—

“> Attending all rehearsals and preparation sessions without giving excuses.


## “Doing your assignments and preparation as per the director’s instructions.

“Arriving on time and not making the team wait for you.

“> Making sure you are present for all repeat shows and their rehearsals.

» Volunteering for additional help during free time, sharing resources like costumes and props.

With all the elements of backstage discussed above, do some of the points sound similar to what your teachers and parents constantly tell you to follow in school or at home? It is true that most of these qualities are applicable in your daily life too. But the only difference is, theatre lets you have fun as you learn these skills.

V Rama Murthy was a backstage professional well-known across the country for his work in lighting, sound, stage design, mime and music. He not only produced many plays and mime shows, but also trained many people/backstage crew, who are successfully employed in theatre till today!

Tapas Sen was an expert

lighting designer between

1940 and 2006. He was like


## a magician with lights, in


## an era when sophisticated

equipment was not available.


## Apart from the numerous

plays he designed lights for

in India, he was invited to

design lights for new year celebrations of the year 2000 at the Eiffel tower, Paris. He designed lights for numerous shows across the world.

Let us make a list of things that you think you can use outside of theatre also. First two have been given as examples —


## THEATRE SKILLS IN MY LIFE

1. Take good care of your belongings—books, uniform and stationary.

2. Practise (study) regularly so you are confident during performance (exams). Saving everything for the last minute will not help.

You are free to add to this list in your notebook.


## HISTORY OF BACKSTAGE

Backstage work for plays is as ancient as theatre, this is because, any performance at any point in history, needs a strong support system working behind it. Infact, the oldest treatise on performing arts—the Natyashastra, written more than 2500 years ago, has an extremely detailed description and step-by-step set of instructions of all that has to be followed in a preparation for the show. History of backstage is called Poorvaranga Vidhi, it elaborates on everything from setting up the musical

instruments, sets and properties to invoking the blessings of Gods to have an uninterrupted show.


## THREE BELLS IN THEATRE

Any professional theatre performance has three bells at different intervals. Each one has a different meaning. This is not just for the cast and crew, but for the audience as well! Here is what they mean:


## pan

Second Bell—Now, the actors are on

stage and in position. Everyone back stage

also gets in position. This is an indication

that the stage mics have been switched

on. The announcement is made (name of the play, playwright, director and special mentions). A strict ban on flash photography and usage of phones during the play are also announced.

Third Bell—The show begins!

The show is like the final exam for the team, after so many rehearsals.

First Bell—An indication for the audience to maintain silence, as the play would start soon. By this time, the sets and props related to the first scene are placed on stage.

Can you identify the three steps that you would follow, to make sure you avoid stress before exams and do well?

There are also detailed descriptions of the structure of Natya Gruha—the place where performances were held and Nepathya the backstage or the entire space around the stage except the audience. The discipline and procedures followed here are called Nepathya Vidhi. It had Mahavarinis (big elephant-shaped pillars) at the corners of the stage where artists would keep the sets and properties ready for entry and exits. Today we have the concept of side wings that do a similar job. Usually theatres have three wings creating three pathways for entry and exit on both sides of the stage.

The importance of backstage work is summarised in the below stanza from the Natyashastra— Chapter 5 Poorvaranga.

a aanter vests WSoTTaAE | ORES z

The Greek Theatre too had such arrangements, specially since the performance space was open-air.

The place where the actors got ready with costumes and masks were behind the performing area, covered by green vineyards, trees and bushes. This is why it was called the Green Room. This is used by performers across the world to this day! The place where make up and costume changes are done are still called Green Rooms, though there is nothing green about it anymore.

Here are some scenarios that can happen

anytime in a theatre performance. Put

yourself in the situation and write down

the solution. You can also come up with more than one solution.

But keep in mind the time required for planning and the actual time available. What is also important is the money involved. For instance, you may not be able to buy an entire new set, as it could get very expensive.


## SCENARIO 1

It is 11 in the morning and the show is scheduled for the same evening. The team has just arrived at the venue for a quick rehearsal. After that they start getting ready for the show. During the rehearsal the main actor falls down accidentally and injures his leg. The injury, as the doctor says, is quite serious and the actor will not be able to walk easily.

You also notice that the costume worn by the actor is also torn. It is not possible to get a different costume as that specific colour and style was made-to-order. It has an important reference in the play. The same costume has also been

SD |1.SCRIPT WRITING ‘WRITE RIGHT'

“Without the script, a play is like a ship without compass. A script anchors the story to the vision.”

With such a major role, it is of utmost importance to understand the details to make sure you have the right script to work on your play.

You have so far learnt the following —


## “> Difference between a story and a script.

“> Three parts of a story: Beginning —Middle—End.

“» Importance of conflict. “> Writing simple conversations.

It is not enough to just learn these concepts. You have to constantly practise them. You may not have to write scripts all the time. You can also identify them in the story books you read or in the movies you watch. It will give you a good understanding of how it is implemented.

We now move on to the next steps of writing a script.

1. STRUCTURE Structure, is simply the order in which you arrange story events. The basic structure that you will have to follow is to ensure you have the following elements —

PROTAGONIST — Who the story is about.

GOAL — What does he/she want?

CONFLICT — Obstacle in his/her path to the goal. RESOLUTION — Does he/she achieve goal? How?

For example, let us look at the Ramayana which we all are familiar with. Identifying the structure, we have: PROTAGONIST — Rama GOAL — Take care of Ayodhya as the king, follow the path of Dharma. CONFLICT — Banished to the forest for 14 years, his wife Sita is kidnapped by Ravana.

RESOLUTION — Finds support of Hanuman to bring back Sita, completes 14 years, returns to rule Ayodhya.


## ad)


## 40 | KRITI

Now, with these main pointers in place, it is easy for you to connect them to form a well-structured story.

You can put this structure to any story. Let us try with stories from your Social Science textbook.


## STORY PROTAGONIST GOAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION


## a. Chandragupta Maurya and Kautilya


## b. Prabhavati Gupta

Excellent! This a great way to understand and remember stories. You can work on more stories like Vikramaditya and Prithviraj Chauhan in your book.

2. CHARACTERS

A script has many characters that support in communicating the story. But when you are writing, you have full control over how many characters you want and what each character does in the story. You, as a writer, have the right to introduce any character and remove any character when you choose to. But, any right comes with responsibility! So, write responsibly.


## KNOW YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS WELL

What do they want in the story? What issues or problems do they have as an individual? (Not to be confused with the conflict of the story.)

Example: Harsha wants to solve the mystery of the sound coming from the backyard of his house. His problem is that he is afraid of darkness.

List out the main characters with these details —


## “ Name, age, background information.

» Individual problem and special features, if any.


## UNDERSTAND THE CHANGES IN CHARACTERS THROUGH THE STORY

Every experience and situation we face brings about a change in us. It could build strength in us or give us a new perspective about a person or change our opinion about something. Just like it happens to us, it can happen to the characters too.

Example: Harsha tries to solve SUPPORTING CHARACTERS the mystery but keeps failing as he avoids going out after dark. One day his Ajji visits and tells him about how she was scared of getting into a bus, but worked on herself to get over it. This inspires Harsha to get over his fear of darkness. So, the story from this point onwards will have Harsha reacting differently when he goes to the backyard after it is dark. This is known as the character arc.

Though the story is not about them, these characters are equally important. The main characters will not be able to do much without these characters. So feel free to add new characters who help the story. But remember to be responsible! Every 5 new character has to have ameaning and _ purpose towards the goal of the script.

Example: Ajji, who helps Harsha overcome his fear is a good supporting character. A scientist who gives information about sound and wind is a good supporting character. But, a milkman who comes home everyday, without contributing to the actual mystery, need not be in the script at all.

| ACTIVITY 3.2.2 | 3.2.2 | ACTIVITY 3.2.3 | 3.2.3

List all supporting actors in your script and check if this character is—

Make a note of characters in terms of thought and

behaviour. *» Making a difference to the main character or the goal? * How are they when the story “> Providing context to a situation. begins?

If they do not, consider removing them.

“> How are they mid-story? *» How are they at the end of the story?

3. SCENES

You must have seen a book divided into chapters. Likewise, parts of a play/movie are divided into scenes. Why is this required? Why can everything not go on continuously?

SCENES ARE DIVISIONS THAT MARK A CHANGE IN TIME,


## PLACE OR ACTION

You have the right to choose how many scenes you want to have. But remember? With rights, come responsibilities! Check for these points for every scene you have. If it does not satisfy them, you will have to rework on the division of scenes. PURPOSE OF A SCENE Does it take the story forward or introduce a new character or bring clarity to a situation? VALID SCENE TRANSITIONS Scene change should not be abrupt, it must follow the thought flow of the audience.

Each scene should logically connect to the previous and next scene. BEGINNING — MIDDLE —END FOR EACH SCENE An introduction, achieving the core purpose and concluding with a lead to the next scene. FIRST SCENE AND LAST SCENE Grab the audience’s attention in the first scene to maintain interest

throughout. End with impact, tying up all loose ends without leaving unanswered questions.

Script Writing Which character in a play or movie you saw, is your favourite? Identify its character arc and flaw.

Since you have to start writing your script, what genre and topic would it be about?

Is there a movie or play

where you thought the script was not good at all? Why?

WRITE YOUR OWN SCRIPT!

Yes, by putting together all that you have learnt till now, you are definitely capable of writing your own script. Here is a quick step-by-step checklist to support you in this process —


## ts

I will write the script [| On my own | In a group (get your team ready with 3-4 friends).

Choose a concept or idea that inspires you (if it doesn’t interest you, it can’t interest your readers).


## Or

## BACKSTAGE— MAKING MAGIC HAPPEN

Theatre is not just about the actors in costumes performing on stage. It is a collective effort. For every successful performance by an actor, there are multiple people working backstage, to make it happen. This builds a spirit of mutual respect and value for work. Backstage work always happens in silence. All the work happens when the play is going on. So, from coordinating to troubleshooting, it is all done in silence (you can probably use your mime skills here!). What is also silent is the congratulatory messages. While most of the applause is taken by the actors, the backstage crew accept the applause and congratulations silently!

The most beautiful feeling of doing backstage work is the feeling of ‘making the magic happen’. After a successful show, you know that your time and effort has been majorly instrumental in that success.

Once upon a qn time, there was a | SeRehS:

girl— Kathanjali, who loved telling stories.

She knew all the stories from ancient history to the most modern ones. She also created stories. She has been living for thousands of years. She has seen many kings and rulers, lived among the common people, and also travelled across the world. So, she remembers the stories she has read and lived through many of the stories! But she is always curious and in search of more interesting stories.

Let us listen to her—

Folk forms of storytelling in India. Problem faced by the artists today. Well-known traditional storytellers.

Namaste! Though I have travelled across the world, my favourite place has always been Bharata. No matter where I am, I prefer to come back here as it feels like home! It has the most beautiful stories. Do you know how it all started? Many, many years ago, when I was going to different places in Bharata, I realised that the people did not know stories at all. They were missing the fun and the values they could learn. I had to find a way to tell them stories. Since I could not do it all by myself, I created storytellers.


## eV

They were people who could remember and narrate stories in very interesting ways. This was fun. There were so many storytellers across the

country telling different stories to everyone from small children to old people.

This went on for hundreds of years. Around the 2nd century BCE, I noticed that the listeners sometimes got bored or were distracted. So I had to find something new to make it interesting. That is when I introduced pictures, music, dance and puppets. Wow! This made storytelling a very different experience for people of all ages. I went to different parts of the country and created different ways of using pictures, music and dance to tell stories, based on their traditions. Do you want to know about some of them?


## 47 | STORY OF INDIA'S STORYTELLING TRADITION


## SD HARIKATHE

During the 12th century, I was travelling in the southern part of Bharata. I visited a lot of beautiful temples and met kings who encouraged art and culture. But, I realised that a lot of people were still unaware of the wonderful stories we have. I remembered Narada Muni who went from one place to another, narrating stories of Lord Vishnu. This would be a great way to tell stories here, I thought. So I encouraged the Bhagavatar community to start telling stories through songs and dance. The people loved it as it was also interactive. Because they narrated the stories of Lord Hari, it came to be known as Harikathe.

It became popular across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The storyteller was called dHarikathe Dasa.


## HARIKATHE — GURURAJULU NAIDU

This multilingual, multitalented storyteller, Gururajulu Naidu, was born in 1931.

His contributions to Harikathe gave him the title Karnataka Harikathe Pitamaha.


## While actual Harikathe performances

were going on all night long, his style revolutionised Harikathe performance, with a duration of 90 minutes, which was welcomed by the audience.

His famous Harikathe performances include Bhakta Markendeya, Bhakta Siriyala, Mahi Ravana, Maya Bazaar, Nallathanga Devi, Gaja Gowri Vrata, Shri Krishna Garudi, Lava Kusha, and many more.

He has also been an actor in movies like


## Mooruvare Vajragalu, Hannele Chiguridaaga, Madhu Malathi, and many more.


## SD KAAVAD KATHA

This is a storytelling tradition that is over 500 years old. When I realised that the common people were unable to read scriptures like the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Puranas and other stories from our tradition, I asked the Bhaats, a craftspeople community in Rajasthan to create an interesting way of using pictures to tell stories. As pictures do not need language, anyone could understand them. So they travelled from village to village with the Kaavad, telling stories to people in their language. They also included songs in it.

They also told stories from the Panchatantra and Hitopadesha for children. These days, they also tell modern stories that give valuable messages that are socially relevant, like educating girl children in villages and maintaining hygiene.

This box of pictures is created with the wood of mango tree. According to the requirement of the story, the boxes have anywhere between 8 to 16 parts. the biggest cover made so far is 25 feet long!

There have been many storytellers in these forms who travelled across

KAAVADIYA — KHOJARAM JI Khojaram ji is from Kumar Dhani near Jodhpur, Rajasthan. He has been practicing Kaavad Katha for more than 40 years now. He is among few surviving Kaavadiyas.

He says, earlier people believed in gyan-daan-bhagwan. Everyone would gather under a tree to listen to Kaavad Katha. Kaavad, as the temple would come to them and they would not just look at the God but listen to the knowledge embedded in the stories of Gods. Now, we go to the jajman’s house once a year. He, like other Kaavadiyas also maintains a book which also keeps the records of people living, dead and newly born, in the families of the neighbourhood.

Don’t you think it is important to keep these traditions alive and spread them across the world?

Connect them to form your own story. Make it as unique as possible. You can also change the order of the pictures.

Think of a unique way of narrating it. You could speak every line in a sing-song tone or add some dance steps to describe situations or think of songs that suit the situation.

You can even try using rhyming words to write your story. That will make it interesting to narrate.

## STORYTELLING — A TREASURE IN TRADITION

You might be wondering why we have to save these storytelling forms. These are oral traditions. Stories have been passed down through generations. Everyone in our country knows about the Ramayana and Mahabharata today because of these oral traditions. Even if a person cannot read or write, these stories can teach them values for life. The most important factor is that they keep our culture and traditions alive. While written books or computer data can be destroyed in seconds, these stories in oral tradition can never be destroyed. So, go ahead and learn a storytelling style and carry the tradition forward!

## NOTE TO THE TEACHERS

The world of music is all about sur, laya and shabd. These elements are woven to express lyrical compositions which express myriad emotions of love, devotion, patriotism, chivalry, appreciation of nature, grief, etc. Music is boundless and is popular among the people of all ages. A crowded and noisy assembly of children in a school suddenly echoes with melody and harmony of musical expression in a peaceful manner. The music curriculum aspires that you and the students thoroughly enjoy the journey of music which has the capacity to unfold immense possibilities. The teachers should aim to instil a lifelong love for music among the learners, fostering a deep appreciation that will grow beyond the classroom. Also, the syllabus of Grade 7 aims to enable students to gain deeper insights to unfold multiple aspects connected to this popular and ever engaging art form.

This section unfolds to let the learners know the different stages of making music. Music has layers, which comprise varied forms of expression through moderation in voices, pitch, tempo, parts of musical instruments, orchestration, and many other elements. A critical review of the songs will help the learners comprehend the varied factors that contribute to creating a composition.

All compositions sung on different occasions are significant. Music can be a resource to propagate many types of messages in a society including— importance of varied occupations and skills, social reforms, health-related issues, etc. It is related to dance and movement, playback music in theatre, film-making, etc. The ‘music’ section will help the learners unravel such aspects.

Examples of some basic skills of practising sargams, traditional folk and classical forms of music have been given. While the teachers should stick to the curriculum and basic guidelines, they have the liberty to introduce the topics in their own way. Also, let the students research and find out more from the sources available to them.

There are many opportunities to experience different genres of music in everyday life. Enthusiastic participation will help them love the art form genuinely and discover the diversity in the Indian context. This book aims to motivate students to appreciate music.

“Consider taking students to live musical performances for exposure.

» Invite a musician to your school and interact with the artist.

There are guidelines for Formative Assessments at the end of each chapter, which should be conducted in a relaxed and engaged manner, and mainly through observation in the classroom. The suggestions for Summative Assessments are provided at the end of the music section. The

## 5_Music.indd 62


## HARMONY AND CANON

When you hear multiple voices of people singing together, creating a pleasing blend of different notes, it is called singing in harmony. Harmony is common in many styles of music, both instrumental and vocal.

There is an easy way to start singing in harmony, and that is, by singing a canon. A canon is where different groups of singers sing the same melody but start at different times. Songs that are written as canons, are written so that the different notes you hear at the same time, sound good together.

You can select any patriotic song, folk song, for example —

2

“ Kuttanadan punjayile kochu penne kuyilale (you learnt in Grade 6)

2

» Hum honge kaamyaab (you learnt in Grade 3)

First, sing the song together. Remember to keep time, so you are all singing together. Then divide the class into two groups.

01-May-25 1:51:32 PM


## Group 1: Hum Honge Group 2: Hum Honge Kamyaab ek


## Kamyaab (2) din

Group 2: Hum Honge Group 1: Hum Honge Kamyaab (2) Kamyaab ek din

Group 1 sings the first line, and continues to the second line.

When Group 1 starts the third line, Group 2 starts singing the first line. Repeat the song a few times, so that you can hear all the harmonies.

If this feels easy, try making four groups! Group 1 starts with the first line, and when they sing the second line, Group 2 starts with the first line and so on. How does it sound when everyone is singing together?


## 63 | MAKING MUSIC


## WD music As TEAMWORK

This era was a time imbued with deep spiritual and musicaltraditions. As the firstrays ofdawn painted the horizon, a team of Vedic priests—Ritvijs, guardians of the sacred hymns, from the four Vedas, assembled in the morning with the institutor, Yajamana and his wife—Yajamana-patni, in the Yaga-shala, to begin the sacred Vedic fire ceremony—the Shrauta-Yajfia.

Amongst this team of ritvijs, there is a unique sub-team of four ritvijs specialised in the Sama-Veda. They are led by the main Sdma-Védi-Ritvij—the Udgata, and together they are known as the Udgatri- Gana. Alongside the Sama-Veda, they are highly skilled in devotional music, both singing and playing traditional musical instruments. They harmonize verses from Sama-Véda Samhita, the divine texts that form the cornerstone of Vedic ceremonies. In the Yaga-shala, facing East (the direction of the rising sun)—an eternal symbol of divinity and renewal— the Sama-Veédi-Ritvijs divided themselves into distinct roles. Each role contributes to the intricate structure and harmonious nature of Sama-Veda chanting known as Sama-gana. The singing of the Sama-gana composition is generally divided into five sections called bhaktis.

1. Prastava: The introduction of the composition is initiated by the Prastota.

2. Udgitha: The primary section, which forms the core of the Sdma-gana recitations, and is sung by the head Ritvij Udgata.

3. Pratihara: Itis sung by continuing from the last line of the Udgitha, by the Pratiharta.

4. Upadrava: The connective musical interlude, ie, the instruments and the rhythmic interpretations, which is again rendered by the Udgata.

5. Nidhana: The concluding section, it is sung in unison by all ritvijs, creating a profound and unified culmination.


## In addition, the fourth Sdma-Vedi-


## Ritvij— Subrahmanya—has the specific duty

of chanting the Subrahmanyahvana. Alongside,


## 5_Music.indd 64

the Yajamana-patni plays an important role by playing the Shatatantri Vina, during the Sama-gana and also singing important sections of the Sama-gana.

This morning ritual was far more than a musical exercise; it was a spiritual offering, a harmonious bridge between humanity and divinity. The symphony of voices and the disciplined roles of the ritvijs exemplified the Vedic pursuit of unity in diversity, reflecting the profound connection between sound, spirituality, and nature.

¥y Music expresses various 3 SS emotions (rasas). When

a you sing or play music,

you are communicating


## a feeling or an emotion.


## In the Indian performing

arts, emotions are referred to as rasas. This

emotion is simultaneously experienced by the

artists and audience. It is this emotion that

connects the artists with the audience. So, always remember to sing with passion and expression.

Let us continue this journey of learning various forms of music and the rasas they express.

The Abhinaya Darpana written by Nandikeshvara says, ‘sabha kalpataru bhaati’ which means, the

audience is like a tree which fulfills your inner wishes. Though this has been written in the context of dance, it applies to all art forms.


## SD DEVOTIONAL Music

People pray in different ways. Music allows people to express the feeling of devotion. People often come together in groups andsing devotionalsongs, in different styles of singing, using a variety of words, tunes and rhythms. Let us understand how the words, tune and rhythm come together when we sing a devotional song.

Here are some examples.

SHABAD — Shabads are musical prayers in the Sikh religion and are sung in the Gurudwara. Let us learn this song.

## MEANING

Icarry a wish in my heart with words on my lips to enable life to shine brightly for everyone, like a guiding light. May my work have the power to uplift the lives of the less fortunate, just as flowers bring beauty to nature. My duties should be able to enhance the lives of others. Let life be marked by care and compassion, and let my purpose be to offer a beacon of hope to my companions.

For the devotional song that you have learnt, think about— «* What is the emotion in the song that you have sung? *» What is the language in which it is sung?

» Make a note of the important words in the song and understand their meaning. This is a great way to increase your vocabulary in a language.

Note to the Teacher: Students can learn one or both songs, or choose devotional songs from their own culture or faith.


## ED CREATIVITY AND STORYTELLING

ACTIVITY 6.2: UNDERSTANDING A PAINTING THROUGH MUSIC *


## RS Oo


## Look at the picture on your left—

Observe it carefully. Based on the style of this painting, can you identify the state or region it is from?

Create two lines which will describe the plates one by one. It can be in your native language. The lines should be rhythmic and easy to sing. For example, “Dekho dekho sakhi dwar pe suj sanwar kay kaun khada”.

Sing it in groups and observe the next plate.

Continue creating lines according to visual images and sing the whole composition.

You can work in groups.

As you create and sing lines in a particular tune and rhythm, you will find the exercise interesting. Document and record the entire process and you will be able to understand how words and music work together to evoke emotions.


## Note to the Teacher

This painting is provided as a reference.

You can select any painting of your choice or from your region.

In the activity, use music as a way to explore the themes in the painting. Try to see some ragamala paintings exhibited in various museums.

Choose a topic from the history section of your Social Science textbook. Here are some choices:


## =» Chandragupta Maurya and Kautilya =» Prabhavati Gupta


## =» Chandragupta II, Vikramaditya and his nine jewels


## = Prithviraj Chauhan

Write a paragraph that describes any story related to the empire of the rulers.

Draw a picture to illustrate the story.

Describe the scene in a few sentences using any language you like.

Sing the lines you have written in a tune of your choice. Wonderful! This is how musicals and musical storytelling is created.

There are many forms ofmusical storytelling in India, including Powada, Kaavad Katha, Alha-Udal and others. You can research and read more about them.

Connect this with other art forms you have been learning and share your experience.

Note to the Teacher: “Art integration is a cross-curricular pedagogical approach that utilises various aspects and forms of art and culture as the basis for learning concepts across subjects. As a part of the thrust on experiential learning, art-integrated education will be embedded in classroom transactions not only for creating joyful classrooms but also for imbibing the Indian ethos through integration of Indian art and culture in the teaching and learning process at every level. This art-integrated approach will strengthen the linkages between education and culture.” [NEP 2020, 4.7]

Plan this session as per the above directive. Let it be a collaboration with the History lesson, so that the students imbibe the artistic traditions prevalent in the country and link it with other curricular areas.

ACTIVITY 6.4: ACTIVE LISTENING *

‘Active listening’ is a term used when you listen to something carefully and try to understand it. Active listening is very important in music. The more you listen to a wide range of music, the more you start to pick up on different styles, structures, and techniques that you might not notice at first. It opens up your ear to different genres, rhythms, or even nuances in production that you would not have recognised otherwise.

» Actively listen to a folk, tribal, modern or contemporary song of your choice, or from a list provided by your teacher.

ACTIVITY 6.5: ACT IT OUT *

» Listen to an instrumental musical piece or background music from a film.

» Take turns to analyse and interpret the piece of music.

«» What are the emotions that you can recognise?

Try to enact the expressions in different compositions.

“> Feel free to use elements that you have learned in Theatre and Dance to communicate the emotions and story of the music.

Every year, we build on our understanding of both styles of Indian Classical Music—Carnatic and Hindustani. This year, we will explore more compositions, Ragas and Talas/Taals. See how you can draw connections between the two styles of classical music, and between classical music and other styles of music that you listen to.

The notes of Indian Classical Music evolved from the ritual chanting of the Samaveda. Initially, the Vedas

were chanted with three notes, namely, Udatta (normal or medium tone), Anudatta (not raised, or lower note) and Svarita (raised pitch or higher). These gradually evolved into the seven notes (sapta swara) that we use in music.

SAMAY CHAKRA (TIME THEORY OF HINDUSTANI RAGAS)

Classical Music is a dharohar, a treasure passed from one generation to another. Ragas in music express emotions and create moods. In Hindustani music, different ragas are sung at different times of the day. A pattern of notes sounds effective if you sing it at a particular time of the day. For example, Raga Bhairav is a morning raga, while Raga Yaman is generally sung in the evening.

## DANCING BODY IN SCULPTURES

> The Vishnudharmottara Purana emphasises the interrelation and interdependence between various art forms.

Dated around 400 to 600 CE, the end of the Gupta period, is also known as the golden age of Indian arts. It understands the importance of spatial concepts of the performing body.

In this text, a discussion occurs between King Vajra and Markandeya on painting and drama in a memorable verse. It states the manifold interrelationship of performing and visual art.

Sage Markandeya instructs, “One who does not know the laws of painting (chitra) can never understand the laws of image-making (shilpa); and, it is difficult to understand the laws of painting (chitra) without any knowledge of the technique of dancing (nrtya)...”.

The precision of geometrical shapes in dance and sculptures was probably worked out due to this interdisciplinary understanding.

## SD NRITYA

In Kriti, Grade 6, you started with a shloka from the Abhinaya Darpana, that gave the concept of the use of hand gestures. This is connected to narration and concentration of the mind in bhava to evoke rasa for a successful performance. Let us recap the shloka and its meaning to present your nritya.

## BEYOND BOUNDARIES

In Kriti, Grade 6, we discussed many dance traditions and the role of male and female dancers. In solo traditions, the solo dancer plays different roles and switches from one character to another. There was a strong tradition of female dancers all over India, who enacted stories and poetries, taking on various roles. Simultaneously, there were male dancers who sometimes performed in the garb of a woman. One such personality is the famous Kuchipudi dancer, Vedantam Satyanarayana Sarma, who performed in female costume.

In traditional dance-drama traditions male dancers often take on the role of women and their costume decides the portrayal of the character. Some dance traditions also use masks for portrayals like Chhau which we learnt about in Kriti, Grade 6.

We will learn about two more such performance traditions where men have traditionally been playing female characters. Though now both traditions are welcoming women into their traditional practises.

Early 20th century CE, the most famous bhagavatar was Natesha Iyer, and after his death, the troupe was continued under G. Swaminathan. Other important persons were Balu Bhagavathar and T.V. Natesh Bhagavathar. E. Krishna Iyer was instrumental in reviving the tradition with the Madras Music Academy in 1950.

Discuss about telling a story and how you can incorporate dance movements in natya with your friends. A story is given below for you to consider or you can choose your own story for presentation and have fun putting it together with choreography.

So, let us dive into this chapter by reading a story and then dancing to the story. That will be interesting and enjoyable.

Note to the Teacher: Do this activity according to your regional languages and practices.


## NATYA

0779CH14

Natya is storytelling through performance. You have read the description of this earlier in the book and read about two natya

In this chapter, you will explore how dance elements can be

One lazy afternoon, Grandma gathered the children to tell them the story of Krishna and the snake Kaliya. She began her story in a soft animated voice bringing the story alive with her dramatic narration.

“Long ago, on the banks of the river Kalindi, there lived a monstrous serpent called Kaliya Naag. He was a terrible creature, hissing and_ coiling, frightening everyone who came near him. Even birds would not fly over the river, and children were too scared to play by its banks. But one day, little Krishna arrived.”

“Now, Krishna was not afraid of anything. He saw the frightened children and decided to help them. He climbed the tallest tree by the river, flute in hand, and began to play it. The music was so sweet and enchanting that it flowed over the water like sunlight on ripples. Even Kaliya couldn’t resist. The great serpent rose from the river, swaying to the melody, his anger forgotten and his eyes shut in joy. Then, Krishna leapt onto Kaliya’s hood and began to dance. Oh, how he danced! His tender feet moved nimbly with such grace and rhythm that even Kaliya, fierce as he was, couldn’t help but join in. Soon, birds were


## 144 | KRITI

singing again, animals came out of hiding, and the children clapped and cheered. Kaliya calmed down and happily, slipped away into the river, never to trouble anyone again.”

The children listened with rapt attention and then excitedly asked grandma to help them enact this natya.

She replied, “Yes we have to plan and design the whole story, choreograph it with dance, music, enactment, costumes and stage design. You see children, through music and dance, even the wildest heart can be calmed. Natya—our beautiful art of storytelling —isn’t just for entertainment. It teaches, it heals, and it brings peace”.

All traditional performances begin with a salutation to seek blessings of the Almighty. Here you will see references of salutation and benediction with reference to natya.

She said, “In our traditions, every play begins and ends with gratitude. Before the performance, we seek blessings for its success—just as we start our day with a prayer or sing during the morning assembly at school. It helps us focus our mind and brings a sense of calm. The salutation is an essential part of any play’s preliminaries in the Indian natya tradition. Let us learn some prayers which can be recited as a salutation to the almighty and as benediction after the conclusion of the natya”.

Here is one example which you can use as a salutation

in your performance or you can select your own.


## SALUTATION


## MEANING

Gajavadana—one who has elephant face (Ganesha)


## Beduve—I pray

Gowri Tanaya—son of Gowri Trijaga—the three worlds Vanditane—worshipped


## 145 | NATYA


## Sujanara — by good people Porevane — protector

Oh elephant faced god! I pray for you. You are the Son of Goddess, Gowri (Parvati). You are worshiped by all the three worlds. You are the protector of all good people such as sages.


## MEANING OF LAST STANZA

Sarasija Nabha — one who has lotus in his navel


## Sri Purandara Vittalana — Lord Vishnu (pen name of purandara daasa)


## Niruta — always

Neneyuvante — make me remember Nee — you


## Dayamaado — shower blessings

Oh Lord Vishnu (Purandara Vittala) the one who has lotus in his navel, shower your blessings to remember you at each and every movement.


## BENEDICTION

Similarly, all performances ends with a benediction. She ended by saying, “And when the play ends, we bow to the audience to thank them for their time, and attention. After all, what is a performance without those who come to watch

it? This exchange of respect is what makes natya so special—it is not just about the story but about the connection it creates between those who perform and those who watch.”

Here is an example of a benediction.


## ACTIVITY 14.1: PLANNING THE PERFORMANCE

You will note down all dance elements that can be incorporated into this natya format.

Divide yourselves into groups. Each group will work out certain dances for the story. The different sections can be:

## NOTE TO THE TEACHERS

VISUAL ARTS PEDAGOGY WOULD NEED TO 1.

Dear Teacher,

Let us take our students deeper into the fascinating world of visual arts, ideas and communication. In this grade, the focusis on broadening their exposure to visual art processes and traditions while honing their skills and techniques. It is important that you read every chapter carefully. You can modify the activities to suit your local context and the specific needs of your students.

To create the best learning experience for every student consider the following points.


## The Visual Arts classroom requires

Ample space for students to work comfortably. Sufficient light and ventilation. Organised storage and easy access to art materials, tools, basic stationery and audio-visual facilities.

4. Space for showcasing and exhibiting artwork periodically.

Use storytelling and everyday examples to introduce concepts and processes.

Encourage students to freely express their original ideas, imaginations, emotions and curiosities in their artwork.

Encourage students to create original artwork inspired by their observations of everyday life and experiences, rather than copying images from other sources.

Allow students to explore, investigate, experiment, collaborate and have dialogues in the classroom. Include outdoor activities and field trips to explore and observe the life and culture around them. Organise visits to museums, heritage monuments and melas.

Invite local artists and craftspeople for interactive sessions, workshops for hands-on experience. Inculcate simple habits of cleaning up after working, putting back used materials and maintain art materials with care.

Encourage students’ participation and decision- making in selecting artwork for classroom display or exhibitions.

Visual arts, assessment should be based on the following Competencies for the Middle Stage.

## OBJECTS IN ICONS


## AND SYMBOLS

Visuals help us communicate with one another. Examine the visuals on this page. Each one gives you information quickly and directly. Such visuals are called icons.

An icon is a simplified visual representation of an object, place or idea. Icons do not show too many details. For example, a mobile phone display has icons depicting the clock, remaining battery charge, network connections, applications, and so on. Below are a few other icons that you come across regularly.

ROL a4 om

In this chapter, you will learn how objects can be represented as icons and symbols to convey information. You will explore how these visual elements are used in logos, signages and even as_ emojis while texting. Through various activities, you will practise drawing objects to make them appear two-dimensional or _ three-dimensional and learn to convert them into icons.

You will also explore how objects take on other meanings when used as symbols.

Look at the two icons of the fork and spoon. The positive space depicts the objects. The negative space is the blank space.

Thus, black is positive in one image and negative in the other. Observe the positive and negative spaces in the other icons. Icons generally have a lot of negative space.

This helps the main object to be visible even in very small sizes.

Choose an object and get ready to draw it. Materials: Five sheets of A5 size (half of A4) paper, sharpened pencil, eraser, colours and pen.


## MAKE A CONTOUR OF AN OBJECT OF YOUR CHOICE

Take an AS paper and a pencil.


## Step 1: Observe and measure.

» Keep the object at more than 2-3 feet distance. *» Closely observe the shape and size of the object. *» Use your pencil as a measuring tool as shown.

» Place your thumb on the pencil, align it with the object to measure its parts.

» Measure and mark the proportions of the object on your paper.


## OBJECTS IN ICONS AND SYMBOLS

Step 2: Draw the contour.

» Keep looking at the object as you draw each part till you complete its contour.


## Note-to.the Teacher

e Each student should individually choose an object to draw.

e Ensure that they use the same object for each artwork in this activity.


## MAKE A SILHOUETTE OF YOUR OBJECT


## Silhouette

Take an AS paper and a pencil.

1.

Draw the contour of the same object again or trace it from the first contour drawing.

Colour inside the contour to make it look flat.

3. Use a different colour to fill the negative space

Optional: On another A5 sheet, make an inverse

image of the silhouette by switching the colours of the positive and negative spaces.


## Cross-hatching Stippling


## 160 | KRITI


## SHADING YOUR OBJECT

Draw your object and make it appear three- dimensional using these two shading techniques:

1. Cross-hatching is a shading technique that uses criss-cross lines.

Closely overlap lines in different directions to create darker tones.

Loosely overlap lines to create lighter tones.


## Stippling

2. Stippling is a shading technique that uses dots.

Place the dots close to one another to create darker tones.

Increase the space between dots to create lighter tones.

Use a separate sheet of A5 paper for each technique.

Step 1: Take the same object you chose for making a silhouette and place it in front of you.

Step 2: Observe and draw its contour.

Step 3: Observe how light falls on the object.

Step 4: Create light and dark tones using cross-hatching technique.

Step 5: Complete your work and keep it aside.

Step 6: Take another A5 paper and draw the contour of the object.

Step 7: Create light and dark tones using stippling.


## MAKE AN ICON OF YOUR OBJECT

Gather your drawings—the contour, silhouettes, cross-hatching and stippling. Which of these will you use to make an icon?

Remember that an icon is a simplified image. But it also needs to be identified quickly. It should, therefore, contain clear shapes and have only important details. Sometimes the silhouette of the object can be the icon.

Make your icon on an AS sheet and complete it with colour.

It takes practice and keen observation to be able to make good icons. If you had to use your icon to communicate information, what would it be?

## | ACTIVITY 15.3: ICONS FOR SIGNAGES | 15.3: ICONS FOR SIGNAGES

Signage informs us where a space is and what it is used for. In this activity, you will create signages using icons of objects for your school.

Step 1: Choose a space in your school such as the entrance, washrooms, play area, a space for eating meals, library, a space to keep your bags, shoes, and so on.

Step 2: Make a list of the objects that come to your mind when you think of this space.

Step 3: Choose the most important object in this space. For example, the door in an exit signage signifies its importance. If you have chosen two objects, try different ways of combining them to create one icon. For example, signage for a dining area can have a spoon and a fork; signage for an art room can have a palette and a brush.

Step 4: Remember that an icon is a simplified drawing that represents the object. *» Experiment with contours and sihouettes.

» Add only those details that characterise the object. Use only one colour.

Step 5: Create the icon in two or more ways.

Step 6: Choose the icon that expresses your purpose best and can be used as a signage for the chosen space. Create this icon on an A5 sheet.

Show the signage to your friends and ask them what they think about it.

Note: Think of the objects that you use regularly while creating icons. For example, you may not use a fork and spoon when you eat. So can you think of alternative icons to represent your food?


## ACTIVITY 15.4: OBJECTS AS SYMBOLS

nation uniting to achieve the vision of Mahatma Gandhi for a clean India.

You have seen that images of objects are created for various purposes. These could be signages for spaces or icons in your surroundings. Objects also become symbols.

Symbols have a deeper meaning and represent ideas or emotions. They may not directly relate to the visual they represent.

Everyday objects like spectacles and a wheel. These become powerful symbols when their meaning is accepted to represent larger ideas. Can you think of other

; . objects that are used as symbols? It is a depiction of the

‘wheel of the law’ taken from the Lion Capital of Sarnath made in the 3rd century BCE by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka.

Look at the logos of companies, institutions and political parties where you see objects used as symbols. What meanings do they symbolise?

IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ICONS AND SYMBOLS?

o,

“> Blue represents the sky and ocean. Remember that symbols have a deeper meaning.

o,

» Wheel represents progress.

Icons can also be symbols if they are given more meanings. Symbols need not resemble what they stand for.

o,

» The spokes represent 24 hours of the day.

For example, Indians can associate round spectacles with Mahatma Gandhi, his values and work. People who cannot make that connection may simply see it as a pair of spectacles.

## PALETTE

Ky Nature showers us with colour every day. A + c rainbow displays the entire range of colours the

human eye can see.

Colours are visible because of light. When light changes, the appearance of colours also changes. A bright red tomato may look dull and dark ina dimly lit room. When there is too much light, everything appears white. When there is no light, everything appears black. In visual art, such effects of light are shown by creating tints, shades and tones of colour.

Colour is an important element of visual art. With regular practice, you will improve your techniques of making, mixing and working with colours. You will learn to use the colour wheel not only for your work, but also to appreciate other artworks.

Not all people see colours the same way. It is important to be sensitive to how each person sees colour. Those who have colour vision impairment, commonly called colour blindness, see a few colours differently. Red may appear brown or they may find it difficult to differentiate between blue and green. There are many visual artists and designers with vision impairment of various kinds. They have excelled in their careers by finding creative solutions to work with their impairments.

Miniature paintings are of many styles and are generally small in size. In India, these were initially done on palm leaves. From the 12th century CE, artists began to use paper as the base for miniature paintings. Their themes included religious texts, mythology, nature, portraiture and court life.


## Mughal miniature Kishangarh miniature

The word ‘miniature’ originates from 'minium’, a red-coloured

pigment that was used to draw outlines and write text in medieval manuscripts.

The table below tells you about the source of some of the colours used in miniatures. These were processed and mixed with gum extracted from the Babul tree to act as a binder.

## Earthy red Geru or red clay


## Yellow Yellow stone or cow urine


## Malachite (copper carbonate)

Natural colours used in miniature painting

It is important to take care of the space we work in, as well as the materials and tools we use for artwork.

Always clean your brushes, palettes and other tools thoroughly with soap after every use. Close paint tubes, bottles, sketch pens and markers with their caps, to prevent colour from drying.

Store all materials in an organised way so that they can be easily found and used by others too.

Imagine you have entered a time machine and have been transported to 8th century CE. You find yourself in front of this massive rock-cut temple sculpture at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu.

You see the sculptors at work. They tell you that they are carving the ‘Descent of Ganga’. Some others tell you the story of ‘Arjuna’s Penance’.

As you watch them work, you imagine the river flows down the cleft between the two boulders and all life gathering around the river. The sculpture brings alive the stories and myths celebrating life around water. Although some figures can be seen very clearly, others look unfinished. Each scene draws you in and you see more.

A relief is a sculpture which stays connected to its base. Its back is usually flat or not sculpted.

Look at the pictures carefully. Locate the same characters in the bigger picture on the previous page.

Since you have learnt to draw facial expressions, reimagine their faces.

Sketch each face with expressions on separate sheets of 15 cm x 15 cm size.

After completing your drawings, choose one, cut it out and keep it ready for your clay relief.


## FIELD TRIP

Visit a heritage monument that has sculptures. Observe the body postures, expressions and emotions they show. Make drawings as you study these.

PROCESS OF MAKING RELIEF IN CLAY Take some natural clay. If it is dry, you need to soak it in some water for a day so that it becomes soft and moist.

Knead your clay (just like you knead dough), and remove stones, pebbles and other impurities in the process.

Your clay should be of j a suitable consistency to work with. Too much water will make it sticky and too little water will make it crack.

Make a ball with the clay and flatten it with your palm.

6) Roll it smoothly

using a rolling pin to create a slab of approximately 15 cm length, 15 cm width and 3 cm height.

For modelling, use tools made of clay, or experiment with blunt kitchen cutlery like spoons, butter knives, icecream sticks, etc.

With a pointed tool, gently trace your paper cut out onto the slab.

Start removing a thin layer of clay from _ the background, so that the surface of the face looks raised.

Gather the clay that you have removed in the shape of a ball and keep it moist.

Add this clay to build facial features like the forehead, eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, cheeks, nose, Marks are made on the desired area to make mouth, chin, etc. : the surface rough. Slip is applied (which acts like a

()) Complete your work and make a hole on the top of the slab with a pencil. This will help you hang your relief.

Allow it to dry for a few days.

Optional: You can paint your clay relief after it is completely dry.


## Mughal portrait

The ‘Descent of Ganga’ shows a wide variety of people with different body types. Look at how people have been depicted in different styles of painting.

Look at people with various body types around you—short, tall, thin, fat, dark-skinned, light- skinned, bald, hairy, hunched, etc. Observe your own body. What thoughts run through your mind?

A stereotype is a widely accepted idea, generalising a person, place or community. It is not factual. Discuss common assumptions that are made about body types, promoting certain stereotypes.


## Dancer in a Jain manuscript


## Bengal patachitra

For example, it is assumed that a person with a large body cannot run fast or a person with a slender body is weak or that one skin colour is more beautiful than another.

The images we see in magazines, hoardings, films, videos and social media influence the way we think about our bodies. Gather more examples of body stereotypes. You may find these in advertisements, story illustrations, videos, films, etc.

Note down your thoughts. Create sketches of your own version that challenge the stereotypes you come across.

Scripts have the power to record people’s languages and expressions.

© India’s writing systems can be traced from the 5000-year old Indus-Sarasvati civilisation. But the earliest decoded inscriptions in Brahmi script from the Ashokan edicts are almost 2300 years old. The original Constitution of India was handwritten by two eal) expert calligraphers. Prem Behari Narain Raizada wrote the English version and Vasant Krishan Vaidya wrote it in Hindi. It was signed on 26 January 1950, the day we observe as Republic Day. Today, the Indian constitution officially recognises 22 languages.

You will learn and discover more about calligraphy in this chapter.

Letters are the smallest unit of any script. An unknown script looks like a string of small drawings. The letters we use today were all initially drawings, which evolved into pictograms and then into organised systems of writing.

## Calligraphy in different scripts and languages

Calligraphy is much more than the art of writing letters to spell words. Artists pour emotions into each letter to create a variety of expressions. They spend a lot of time and effort in writing, inscribing and carving by hand. Each letter style has a purpose. In ancient manuscripts, letters were decorative and flowed with life. Some letters were creatively placed to look like a frame or picture. Today’s newspapers use bold and clear letters to draw our attention and help readers read information quickly.

The materials and tools used in calligraphy include a variety of quills, brushes, nibs, inks and paints on surfaces like palm leaf, cloth, paper, and so on.

Incredible {india "

Which letters can you find in the Indian Rupee symbol? The symbol of the Indian rupee is derived from the letter ¥ from the word Rupiah in the Devanagari script. The top horizontal line also known as the Shiro-Rekha of the Devanagari script, gives it an Indian identity. Seen along with the second horizontal line, it represents the three bands of the tricolour of our Indian flag.

Just by playing around with lines and shapes of letters, you can enhance an idea.

Observe the ‘Incredible India’ logo. The exclamation mark in place of the letter T makes it more expressive. What kind of letter play do you observe in the other logos? Discuss and note your observations.


## | ACTIVITY 19.2: LETTER HUNT 19.2: LETTER HUNT

Before digital technology, printing involved long processes. Visit a newspaper office or print studio to find out more about the printing processes.

Let us begin a treasure hunt activity using print material found in our surroundings.

Step 1: Collect a few newspapers, and printed material including invitation cards, food packaging material and old magazines.

Step 2: Discuss and write your thoughts about — “> How are the words or letters arranged?

“» Why do you think the letters are printed in different colours and sizes?

«> What do you find attractive in the style of letters or words?

» Which words on the printed material are most important? Why?

Step 3: Cut out words and letters of different sizes and


## styles.

Step 4: Work in groups to find similar letter styles. For example, decorative, bold, italic, thin, narrow, etc.

Step 5: Arrange and paste them on an A3-size paper by grouping similar letter styles.

## ACTIVITY 19.3: SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT

Observe the table below. It shows different versions of the same letter.

Are you able to read the same letter written in so many ways?

This is similar to human or animal bodies. We have the same body parts, yet we look unique. Human anatomy is about the number of bones, muscles, joints, etc. Similarly, the anatomy of letters reveals the different parts of a letter.


## D

=

Step 1: Choose a letter from any script you are familiar with.

Step 2: Take a sheet of paper and write the letter you have chosen in different ways.

Step 3: Start by writing letters freely. Use your non-dominant hand, and see the lines and shapes that are formed. Use different kinds of pens, pencils and other writing tools. Make the letters big and small.

Step 4: Take another sheet of paper. To structure the same letter, mark a baseline, top line and a middle line.

Step 5: Mark vertical lines to create a grid. This will help you estimate the width of each alphabet, as well as the space between each letter.

Step 6: Create five variations of the same letter. Use the guidelines to alter the height, width, angles and line-thickness of the letters to achieve different styles. Begin writing the letter, keeping in mind its anatomy.

Step 7: Share your work with your peers. Discuss how you wrote one letter in different ways.


## ACTIVITY 19.4: WRITING LIKE WE SPEAK

When you speak to people, you modulate your voice which creates a variation in the volume. Doing this conveys various emotions. For example, when you wish your friend “Happy Birthday!” you say it with excitement and joy, whereas when you say, “Get well soon”, you say it calmly and show concern.

If we relate it to writing, it could be that a loud voice is written in big, bold letters, whereas softer voice is written in small letters.

Now, why don’t you try to shape letters in a variety of ways to convey the meanings and emotions of words?

Look at the examples on the right side and try creating your own in a language or script that you are comfortable with.


## Note to the Teacher

Calligraphy skills are used in a variety of

professions and vocations — tattooing, graphic art, illustration, animation, and so on.

20) INTEGRATION OF ALL ART FORMS


## — SCULPTURES COME ALIVE! si

Art is a powerful language that speaks to your mind and heart. What you feel and experience during a concert or while viewing a painting is something that cannot be put in words. Now, imagine all these art forms that you have learnt, coming together to give one unique experience! You are about to try doing that here!

The objective of this activity is to inspire creativity and collaboration by using ancient sculptures as a starting point to build a story, and then bringing it to life through performance with music, movement and dialogue.

1. Preparation

Look at all the pictures of sculptures and stone carving in the book. It is there in all the four sections. You can also find more pictures from the ones found around you or

from the places to where you have travelled (these could include depictions of gods, dancers, warriors, animals or everyday life scenes).

» You can also discuss with your social science teacher to provide more pictures of sculptures that could be used in the story.

2. Story Creation


## “» Make small groups (4-6 students).

» Each group carefully examines the sculptures, and imagine the lives, emotions and actions of the figures depicted.

» With help from your teacher, create a story that connects the sculptures in a meaningful way. For example:


## ¢ Aheroic adventure of a warrior statue.

¢ A festival scene featuring dancers and musicians.

¢ Adivine story featuring gods and mythical creatures.


## ¢ Asimple tale from the life of common people.

» Arrange the pictures in the order of how the story progresses, so it makes sense when you

look at it (almost like a comic strip but with sculptures!). Make it as creative and unique as possible.


## Incorporating Art Forms

» Visual art—Imagine the parts of the story

which don’t have pictures and make your own drawings to connect and express the story. Recall the familiar visual storytelling traditions that you have learnt about in this book like Phad or Patachitra. Take inspiration from these and create your own visual narrative. Think about the variety of materials and techniques

you can use to express your story. Movement—Include dance or _ body movements and gestures to represent the hastas and postures of the sculptures. Dialogue—Write short dialogues or monologues for the characters inspired by the expressions or postures in the sculptures. This should help in taking the story forward. Music/Songs—Add_ traditional music or create simple songs that fit the story. You can clap, hum or use available instruments to create rhythm.
