## FOREWORD

The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rootedin an Indian ethos andits civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pafichakoshas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the stage for further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages.

The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Science, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy —a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook of Mathematics for Grade 7, Part I, aligns with the expectations of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, with respect to creating a spark for initiating mathematical thinking. This textbook designed for Grade 7 students, takes forward its journey through the world of mathematics that started in Grade 6. During this journey the concepts and problems emerge from daily life situations and so it is expected that students will be able to relate to them with ease. The book makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore the patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas such as science, social science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). Colourful illustrations and interactive exercises form the basis of this textbook that would develop a strong foundation among children in understanding more complex mathematical

concepts. Throughout the book, stories, conversations and anecdotes have been incorporated to make abstract mathematical concepts more relatable and accessible to young learners. Puzzles and innovative problems will not only engage the students in thoughtfully relating the mathematical concepts to the world around them and help them in deepening their understanding of mathematics, but also prepare them to understand the concepts of the emerging field of computational thinking. The focus is on collaboration and active engagement through student-centered approach to education.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

## ABOUT THE BOOK

Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics can also contribute to the development of capacities for making informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus has an important role to play in achieving the overall aims of school education.

Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and has to perform the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of the child and being abstract. It must perform the dual role of developing intuition while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It must perform the dual role of enhancing critical and logical thinking while also developing artistry and creativity and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Finally, Mathematics must perform the dual role of providing students plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovery of concepts on their own while also teaching best- known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics.

The present textbook has made an attempt to address the above mentioned goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers of this book have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods to develop in students both intuition and rigour. The book also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student-teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the book to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open- ended to stimulate in-class discussion.

The first chapter of this book, ‘Large Numbers Around Us’, is anintroduction to the world of lakhs and crores, and millions and billions through engaging explorations and contexts.

Chapter 2, ‘Arithmetic Expressions’, considers expressions having multiple operations and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3, ‘A Peek Beyond the Point’, introduces the usage of the decimal point and additions and subtractions involving decimal numbers. Chapter 4, ‘Expressions using Letter-Numbers’ builds on the chapter on Arithmetic Expressions to guide students to take the first steps into the world of algebra. The fundamental notions of letter-numbers and algebraic expressions are introduced. Chapter 5, ‘Parallel and Intersecting Lines’, introduces some fundamental building blocks of geometry and has a balance of engaging activities like paper folding and rigorous mathematical reasoning. Chapter 6, ‘Number Play’, covers aspects of computational thinking and problem solving through puzzles and concepts of parity, the Virahanka-Fibonacci sequence, and cryptarithms. Chapter 7, ‘A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines’,

explores, through construction, some of the striking properties of a triangle related to the lengths of their sides and angles. Chapter 8, ‘Working with Fractions’, builds on the students’ understanding of fractions, and explores the multiplication and division of fractions. The methods and formulas of the great Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (628 CE) for performing these operations on fractions is brought alive with fresh examples and interesting puzzles. In all chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History, and Science.

By weaving together storytelling and hands-on activities, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give children the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other, provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage children to find many different ways to solve problems.

As per the NEP 2020, computational thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage such thinking. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics.

The concepts and problems are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials with which the students are familiar. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used. At many places, exercises or activities are given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. The textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom.

We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers will use this as an opportunity to revise these concepts ina spiralling way so that children are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may give more time to the ideas of fractions, negative numbers and other notions that are new to students. Many of these are the basis for further learning in mathematics.

Finally, this book aims to be more than just a textbook—it’s a passport to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration. Whether used in the classroom or at home, we hope that it may inspire students to embark on their own mathematical adventures, empowering them to see the beauty and relevance of mathematics in everything around them. With its engaging approach and comprehensive coverage of Grade 7 mathematics concepts, this book hopes and aims to captivate young minds and set them on a lifelong journey of mathematical discovery.

I thank again all the writers of and contributors to this textbook for this important and valuable contribution and service to the nation’s mathematics teachers, learners and enthusiasts.

We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding the book and hope that you will send interesting exercises, activities and tasks that you develop during the course of teaching and learning, to be included in future editions.

## NOTE TO THE TEACHER

We hope that this book, Ganita Prakash, will serve as a strong support and guide to you in achieving the exciting task that you have before you: that of passing on the joy of learning the beautiful subject of Mathematics to the next generation.

This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms, where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions.

Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups.

Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.

While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics.

It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students.

To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this book are marked using the icon 2; This icon is an indicator of a potential opportunity to start off a process of problem solving and exploration in the classroom. You will find some of the problems labelled “Math Talk”. Such questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion.

An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problem-solving approaches. These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations.

To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to “cover” all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them.

It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration.

Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting word problems.

This book contains a number of open-ended problems. It also contains new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to solve them or follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay! Not everyone knows everything. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, it will be very useful to take it to the classroom and open it up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. This process itself can throw a lot of light on the content.

In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them.

It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful time using this book!


## Summary of Key Points Time for Exploration

1. It is important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns, or challenges to the students and give them sufficient time to play with, discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups.

2. During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.

3. There should be a culture where students pose problems to each other and discuss with each other various ways to approach the problems.


## About the Problems in the Book

1. The exploratory problems in the book not only promote problem solving; they also aim to strengthen procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration.

2. Trying to ‘cover’ all the problems in the book must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with, discussing, and solving them.


## Reading

1. Encourage students to read the book by themselves and in groups.

2. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and to express it to others.


## Right of Not Knowing!

1. Itis perfectly okay ifsome of the content is not understood immediately. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, it can also be taken to the classroom and opened up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them!

2. Learning is a continual process. Indeed, there is so much in mathematics that is still not known and requires further exploration!

A NOTE TO STUDENTS!

To be able to appreciate the art of mathematics, it is not enough to just be a passive spectator. You need to immerse yourself in its process like a detective getting into action to solve a mystery.

This is especially required when you see a new question or when a question arises from your own sense of wonder, or when you come across a new beautiful pattern. When you encounter these, pause your reading, and use your creativity to work out the question or understand and appreciate the pattern.

You will find that some questions are accompanied by their answers. Even if this is the case, it is worthwhile to work on the problems by yourself or in a group before you see the answer.

This will enrich your experience of going through the book!

Whenever there are questions coming up, you will see this icon: (?): This indicates that it is time for figuring things out!

## 1.1 A Lakh Varieties!

Eshwarappa is a farmer in Chintamani, a town in Karnataka. He visits the market regularly to buy seeds for his rice field. During one such visit he overheard a conversation between Ramannaand Lakshmamma. Ramanna said, “Earlier our country had about a lakh varieties of rice. Farmers used to preserve different varieties of seeds and use them to grow rice. Now, we only have a handful of varieties. Also, farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds”.

Lakshmamma said, “There is a seed bank near my house. So far, they have collected about a hundred indigenous varieties of rice seeds from different places. You can also buy seeds from there.”

You may have heard the word ‘lakh’ before. Do you know how big one lakh is? Let us find out.

Eshwarappa shared this incident with his daughter Roxie and son Estu.

Estu was surprised to know that there were about one lakh varieties of rice in this country. He wondered “One lakh! So far I have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new variety each day, would we even come close to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100 years?”

What do you think? Guess.

Roxie and Estu found that if they ate one variety of rice a day, they would come nowhere close to a lakh ina lifetime! Roxie suggests, “What if we ate 2 varieties of rice every day? Would we then be able to eat 1 lakh varieties of rice in 100 years?”

What if a person ate 3 varieties of rice every day? Will they be able to taste all the lakh varieties in a 100 year lifetime? Find out.

Estu said, “We know how many days there are in a year — 365, if we ignore leap years. If we live for y years, the number of days in our lifetime will be 365 x y.”

Eshwarappa asked Roxie and Estu, “Is a lakh big or small?” Roxie feels that 1 lakh is a large number:

e “We had one lakh varieties of rice —that is a lot.”

“Living 1 lakh days would mean living for 274 years — that is a really long time!”

¢ “If 1 lakh people stood shoulder to shoulder in a line they could stretch as far as 38 kilometres.”

Estu, however, thinks it is not that big:

« “Do you know that the cricket stadium in Ahmedabad has a seating capacity of more than 1 lakh? One lakh people in such a small area!”

¢ “Most humans have 80,000 to 1,20,000 hairs on their heads. Imagine, 1 lakh hairs fit in such a tiny space!”

¢ “I heard that there are some species of fish where a female fish can lay almost one lakh eggs at once very comfortably. Some even lay tens of lakhs of eggs at a time.”

?) How do you view a lakh —is a lakh big or small?


## Reading and Writing Numbers

We have already been using commas for 5-digit numbers like 45,830 in the Indian place value system. As numbers grow bigger, using commas helps in reading the numbers easily. We use a comma in between the digits representing the “ten thousands” place and the “one lakh” place as you have seen just before (1,00,000).

The number name of 12,78,830 is twelve lakh seventy eight thousand eight hundred thirty.

Similarly, the number 15,75,000 in words is fifteen lakh seventy five thousand.

Write each of the numbers given below in words:

(a) 3,00,600 (b) 5,04,085 (c) 27,30,000 (d) 70,53,138

(a) One lakh twenty three thousand four hundred and fifty six (b) Four lakh seven thousand seven hundred and four

(c) Fifty lakhs five thousand and fifty

(d) Ten lakhs two hundred and thirty five

Note to the Teacher: Encourage students to make connections between these facts. For example, can the whole population of Chintamani fit in the stadium? How can we imagine the line of 38 km, having a lakh people, sitting next to each other in the stadium?


## 1.2 Land of Tens

In the Land of Tens, there are special calculators with special buttons.

What if we press the +10,00,000 button ten times? What number will come up? How many zeroes will it have? What should we call it? The number will be 100 lakhs, which is also called a crore. 1 crore is written as 1,00,00,000 — it is 1 followed by seven zeroes.


## 1.3 Of Crores and Crores!

The table below shows some numbers according to both the Indian system and the American system (also called the International system) of naming numerals and placing commas. Observe the placement of commas in both systems.

Indian System American System 1,000 One thousand 1,000 One thousand 10,000 Ten thousand 10,000 Ten thousand

1,00,000 One lakh 100,000 Hundred thousand 10,00,000 Ten lakhs 1,000,000 One million

1,00,00,000 One crore 10,000,000 Ten million 10,00,00,000 Ten crores 100,000,000 Hundred million


## 1,00,00,00,000 One arab or One | 1,000,000,000 One billion hundred crores

Notice that in the Indian system, commas are placed to group the digits in a 3-2-2-2... pattern from right to left (thousands, lakhs, crores, etc.). In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a 3-3-3-3... pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.).

The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and Myanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words laksha (aa) and koti (#\fe). The American system is also used in many countries.

Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore.

1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes. 1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes.

A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).

What do you think of this conversation? Have you read or heard such headlines or statements?

Very often, exact numbers are not required and just an approximation is sufficient. For example, according to the 2011 census, the population of Chintamani town is 76,068. Instead, saying that the population is about 75,000 is enough to give an idea of how big the quantity is.

Icalled the rounded off


## <7 f} number, of course!

My teacher told

people deal with rounded off numbers.

There are situations where it makes sense to round up a number (rounding up is when the approximated number is more than the actual number). For example, if a school has 732 people including students, teachers and staff: the principal might order 750 sweets instead of 700 sweets.

There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down is when the approximated number is less than the actual number). For example, if the cost of an item is %470, the shopkeeper may say that the cost is around %450 instead of saying it is around %500.

(?) Think and share situations where it is appropriate to (a) round up,

(b) round down, (c) either rounding up or rounding down is okay and (d) when exact numbers are needed.

## ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS

0774cHO2


## 2.1 Simple Expressions

You may have seen mathematical phrases like 13 + 2, 20-4, 12 x 5, and 18 + 3. Such phrases are called arithmetic expressions.

Every arithmetic expression has a value which is the number it evaluates to. For example, the value of the expression 13 + 2 is 15. This expression can be read as ‘13 plus 2’ or ‘the sum of 13 and 2’.

We use the equality sign ‘=’ to denote the relationship between an arithmetic expression and its value. For example:

13+ 2=15.

Example 1: Mallika spends %25 every day for lunch at school. Write the expression for the total amount she spends on lunch in a week from Monday to Friday.

The expression for the total amount is 5 x 25. 5x25 is “5 times 25” or “the product of 5 and 25”.

Different expressions can have the same value. Here are multiple ways to express the number 12, using two numbers and any of the four operations +,-—, x and +:

10+2,15-3,3%4, 24+ 2.

(?) Choose your favourite number and write as many expressions as you

can having that value.


## Comparing Expressions

As we compare numbers using ‘’, ‘<’ and ‘>’ signs, we can also compare expressions. We compare expressions based on their values and write the ‘equal to’, ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ sign accordingly. For example,

10+2>7+1

because the value of 10 + 2 = 12 is greater than the value of 7+1= 8. Similarly,

13-2<4x3.

2. Arrange the following expressions in ascending (increasing) order of their values.

(2) Example 2: Which is greater? 1023 + 125 or 1022 + 128?

Imagining a situation could help us answer this Raja (1023 + 125) without finding the values. Raja had 1023 marbles and got 125 more today. Now he has 1023 + 125 marbles. Joy had 1022 marbles and got 128 more today. Now he has 1022 + 128 marbles. Who has more?

This situation can be represented as shown in the picture on the right. To begin with, Raja had 1 more marble than Joy. But Joy got 3 more marbles than Raja today. We can see that Joy has (two) E7ee0e@ more marbles than Raja now.

That is,

Joy (1022 + 128)

1023 + 125 < 1022 + 128.

(©) Example 3: Which is greater? 113 - 25 or 112 - 24?

Imagine a situation, Raja had 113 marbles and lost 25 of them. He has 113 - 25 marbles. Joy had 112

Raja (113 - 25)

marbles and lost 24 today. He has 112 - 24 marbles. “24> , Who has more marbles left with them? remove

Raja had 1 marble more than Joy. But he also lost 1 marble more than Joy did. Therefore, they have an equal number of marbles now.

## 2.2 Reading and Evaluating Complex Expressions

Sometimes, when an expression is not accompanied by a context, there can be more than one way of evaluating its value. In such cases, we need some tools and rules to specify how exactly the expression has to be evaluated.

To give an example with language, look


## at the following sentences:

(a) Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a


## friend with toys”.

Meaning: The friend has toys and

Shalini sat next to her.

(b)

Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a friend, with toys”.

Meaning: Shalini has the toys and she sat with them next to her friend.

This sentence without the punctuation could have been interpreted in two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how

the sentence has to be understood.

Let us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way.

Example 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun

brought 5 bags of marbles with 4 marbles in each bag. How many marbles did Mallesh and Arun bring to the playground?

Mallesh summarized this by writing the mathematical expression — 30+5 x4.

## Arithmetic Expressions

Without knowing the context behind this expression, Purna found the value of this expression to be 140. He added 30 and 5 first, to get 35, and then multiplied 35 by 4 to get 140.

Mallesh found the value of this expression to be 50. He multiplied 5 and 4 first to get 20 and added 20 to 30 to get 50.

In this case, Mallesh is right. But why did Purna get it wrong?

Just looking at the expression 30 + 5 x 4, it is not clear whether we should do the addition first or multiplication.

Just as punctuation marks are used to resolve confusions in language, brackets and the notion of terms are used in mathematics to resolve confusions in evaluating expressions.


## Brackets in Expressions

In the expression to find the number of marbles — 30 + 5 x 4— we had to first multiply 5 and 4, and then add this product to 30. This order of operations is clarified by the use of brackets as follows: 30 + (5 x 4). When evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find the values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing other operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value

of 5 x 4, and then do the addition. Thus, this expression describes the number of marbles:

30+ (5 x 4) = 30 + 20 = 50.

Example 5: Irfan bought a pack of biscuits for 15 and a packet of toor dal for =56. He gave the shopkeeper #100. Write an expression that can help us calculate the change Irfan will get back from the shopkeeper.

Irfan spent %15 on a biscuit packet and %56 on toor dal. So, the total cost in rupees is 15 + 56. He gave £100 to the shopkeeper. So, he should get back 100 minus the total cost. Can we write that expression as—

100-15 + 56?

Can we first subtract 15 from 100 and then add 56 to the result? We will get 141. It is absurd that he gets more money than he paid the shopkeeper!

We can use brackets in this case:

100 - (15 + 56).

Evaluating the expression within the brackets first, we get 100 minus 71, which is 29. So, Irfan will get back €29.

## Terms in Expressions

Suppose we have the expression 30 + 5 x 4 without any brackets. Does it have no meaning?

When there are expressions having multiple operations, and the order of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion of terms to determine the order.

Terms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For example, in 12+7, the terms are 12 and 7, as marked below.

We will keep marking each term of an expression as above. Note that this way of marking the terms is not a usual practice. This will be done until you become familiar with this concept.

Now, what are the terms in 83 — 14? We know that subtracting a number is the same as adding the inverse of the number. Recall that the inverse of a given number has the sign opposite to it. For example, the inverse of 14 is -14, and the inverse of -14 is 14. Thus, subtracting 14 from 83 is the same as adding -14 to 83. That is,

Thus, the terms of the expression 83 - 14 are 83 and -14.

?) Check if replacing subtraction by addition in this way does not change

the value of the expression, by taking different examples. inverse, using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class


## 6 textbook of mathematics?

All subtractions in an expression are converted to additions in this manner to identify the terms. Here are some more examples of expressions and their terms:

Note that 6 x 5,4 x 6 are single terms as they do not have any ‘+’ sign. In the following table, some expressions are given. Complete the table.

Now we will see how terms are used to determine the order of operations to find the value of an expression.

We will start with expressions having only additions (with all the subtractions suitably converted into additions).

Does changing the order in which the terms are added give different values?


## Swapping and Grouping

Let us consider a simple expression having only two terms.

Example 6: Madhu is flying a drone from a terrace. The drone goes 6m up and then 4m down. Write an expression to show how high the final position of the drone is from the terrace.

The drone is 6-4 = 2 m above the terrace. Writing it as sum of terms:

Will the sum change if we swap the terms?

It doesn’t in this case. We already know that swapping the terms does not change the sum when both the terms are positive numbers.

Will this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as

well? Take some more expressions and check.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

?) Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? Thus, in an expression having two terms, swapping them does not change the value.

(erm?) + (Ferm2)= (Germ 2) + (erm 2)

Now consider an expression having three terms: (—7) + 10 + (-11). Let us add these terms in the following two different orders:

O:.@-@

(adding the first two terms and then adding their sum to the third term)

D:@:@

(adding the last two terms and then adding their sum to the first term) What do you see? The sums are the same in both cases. Again, we know that while adding positive numbers, grouping them in any of the above two ways gives the same sum.

Will this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as well? Take some more expressions and check.

(?) Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? [7

Thus, grouping the terms of an expression in either of the following ways gives the same value.

Let us consider the expression (—7) + 10 + (-11) again. What happens when we change the order and add -7 and -11 first, and then add this sum to 10? Will we get the same sum as before?

We see that adding the terms of the expression (—7) + 10 + (-11) in any order gives the same sum of -8.

?) Does adding the terms of an expression in any order give the same value? Take some more expressions and check. Consider expressions with more than 3 terms also.

?) Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of

integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? (is Thus, the addition of terms in any order gives the same value. Therefore, in an expression having only additions, it does not matter in what order the terms are added: they all give the same value.

Now let us consider expressions having multiplication and division

also, without the order of operations specified by the brackets. The values of such expressions are found by first evaluating the terms.

Once all the terms are evaluated, they are added. For example, the expression 30 + 5 x 4 is evaluated as follows:

The expression 5 x (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 is evaluated as follows:

Where (3+2) is first evaluated and this sum is multiplied by 5 (= 25). The expression 7 x 8 is evaluated (= 56). This simplifies to 25 + 56+ 3=

84.

of addition instead of saying “swapping terms does not change the sum”. Similarly, “grouping does not change the sum” is called the associative property of addition.

## Removing Brackets—I

Let us find the value of this expression, 200 — (40 + 3).

We first evaluate the expression inside the bracket to 43 and then subtract it from 200. But it is simpler to first subtract 40 from 200:

200 — 40 = 160. And then subtract 3 from 160: 160-3 = 157. What we did here was 200 — 40 — 3. Notice, that we did not do 200 - 40 + 3.

So, 200 — (40 + 3) = 200 —- 40-3.

?) Example 12: We also saw this earlier in the case of Irfan purchasing a biscuit packet (€15) and a toor dal packet (%56). When he paid %100, the change he gets in rupees is:

100 - (15 + 56) = 29. The change could also have been calculated as follows: (a) First subtract the cost of the biscuit packet (15) from 100: 100-15 =85. This is the amount the shopkeeper owes Irfan if he had

purchased only the biscuits. As he has purchased toor dal also, its cost is taken from this remaining amount of 85.

(b) So, to find the change, we need to subtract the cost of toor dal from 85.

85 —56 = 29. What we have done here is 100 — 15 — 56. So, 100 - (45 + 56) = 100-15 -56.

Notice how upon removing the brackets preceded hy a negative sign, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. Observe


## Gs) Ww

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

the signs of 40 and 3 in the first example, and that of 15 and 56 in the second.

?) Example 13: Consider the expression 500 — (250 — 100). Is it possible to

write this expression without the brackets?

To evaluate this expression, we need to subtract 250 - 100 = 150 from 500:

500 — (250 — 100) = 500 — 150 = 350. If we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have subtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back

that 100 to 500 - 250 to make the expression take the same value as 500 — (250 - 100). This sequence of operations is 500 — 250+100. Thus,

500 - (250 — 100) = 500 - 250 + 100. Check that 500 — (250 - 100) is not equal to 500 — 250 - 100. Notice again that when the brackets preceded by a negative sign

are removed, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. In this case, the signs of 250 and — 100 change to — 250 and 100.

?) Example 14: Hira has a rare coin collection. She has 28 coins in one bag

and 35 coins in another. She gifts her friend 10 coins from the second bag. Write an expression for the number of coins left with Hira.

This can be expressed by 28 + (35 — 10).

We know that this is the same as 28 + (35 + (-10)). Since the terms can be added in any order, this expression can simply be written as 28 + 35 + (-10), or 28 + 35 — 10. Thus,

28 + (35 — 10) = 28 + 35-10 = 53.

When the brackets are NOT preceded by a negative sign, the terms within them do not change their signs upon removing the brackets. Notice the sign of the terms 35 and — 10 in the above expression.

Rather than simply remembering rules for when to change the sign and when not to, you can figure it out for yourself by thinking about the meanings of the expressions.

## Arithmetic Expressions

Writing it as sum of terms gives:

@-4) + (24)

This expression means 24 more than

2 x 43. But, we want an expression which means twice or double of 43 + 24.

We can make use of brackets to write such an expression: 2 x (43 + 24)

2 x (43 + 24).

So, we can Say that together they have to pay 2 x (43 + 24). This is also the same as paying for two vegetable cutlets and two rasgullas:

2x 43 +2 x 24. Therefore,

2x (43+ 24)=2x43+2x 24. 2% 43+2x%24

If another friend, Sangmu, joins them and orders the same items, what will be the expression for the total amount to be paid?

The number of boy scouts marching is 4 x 5. The number of girl guides marching is 3 x 5. The total number of

(4+ 3)x5=7x5=35 ?) 5x4+3+#5x (4+ 3). Can you explain why? Is 5 x (4+ 3) =5 x (3+ 4) = (3+ 4) x 5? The observations that we have made in the previous two examples can be seen in a general way as follows.

Consider 10 x 98 + 3 x 98. This means taking the sum of 10 times 98 and 3 times 98.

98 +98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 +98 + 98 + 98 + 98


## 10 times 3 times

Clearly, this is the same as 10 + 3 = 13 times 98. Thus, 10 x 98 +3 x 98 = (10 + 3) x 98. Writing this equality the other way, we get (10 + 3) 98 =10 x 98 + 3 x 98.

Swapping the numbers in the products above, this property can be seen in the following form:

98 x 10 + 9 x 83 = 98 (10 + 3), and 98 (10 + 3) = 98 x 10 + 98 x 3.

Similarly, let us consider the expression 14 x 10-6 x 10. This means subtracting 6 times 10 from 14 times 10.


## 14 times

——. — — — -.

10+10+10+10+10+10+10 + 10 +40+40+40+49+49+40

Clearly, this is 14 - 6 = 8 times 10. Thus, 14x 10-6 10= (14-6) x 10, or (14-6) x 10= 14x 10-610 This property can be nicely summed up as follows:

The multiple ofasum (difference) is the same as the sum (difference) of the multiples.


## Tinker the Terms II

Let us understand what happens when we change the numbers occurring in a product.

eee SUMMARY) J----------2--------------

We have been reading and evaluating simple expressions for quite some time now. Here we started by revising the meaning of some simple expressions and their values.

We learnt how to compare certain expressions through reasoning instead of bluntly evaluating them.

To help read and evaluate complex expressions without confusion, we use terms and brackets.

When an expression is written as a sum of terms, changing the order of the terms or grouping the terms does not change the value of the expression. This is because the “commutative property of addition” and the “associative property of addition”, respectively.

To evaluate expressions within brackets, we saw that when we remove brackets preceded by a negative sign, the terms within the bracket change their sign.

We also learnt about the “distributive property” — multiplying a number with an expression inside brackets is equal to the multiplying the number with each term in the bracket.

4/12/2025 11:27:36 AM


## Arithmetic Expressions

Using three 3’s along with the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and brackets as needed we can create several expressions. For example, (3 + 3)/3 = 2, 3 + 3-3 = 3,3 x 3 +3 = 12, and so on.

Using four 4’s, create expressions to get all values from 1 to 20.

Using the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once in any order get as many values as possible between —10 and +10.

Using the numbers 0 to 9 exactly once in any order, make an expression with a value 100.

What other similar interesting questions can you ask?

## A PEEK BEYOND THE POINT

0774CHO3


## 3.1 The Need for Smaller Units

Sonu’s mother was fixing a toy. She was trying to join two pieces with the help of a screw. Sonu’ was watching his mother with great curiosity. His mother was unable to join the pieces. Sonu asked why. His mother said that the screw was not of the right size.

She brought another screw from the box and was able to fix the toy. The two screws looked the same to Sonu. But when he observed them closely, he saw they were of slightly different lengths.

Sonu was fascinated by how such a small difference in lengths could matter so much. He was curious to know the difference in lengths. He was also curious to know how little the difference was because _ the screws looked nearly the same.

In the following figure, screws are placed above a scale. Measure them and write their length in the space provided.

Which scale helped you measure the length of the screws accurately? Why?

?) What is the meaning of 2 a cm (the length of the first screw)?

As seen on the ruler, the unit length between two consecutive numbers is divided into 10 equal parts. To get the length 2 z cm, we go from 0 to 2 and then take seven parts of nT The length of the screw

is 2cm and a cm. Similarly, we can make sense of the length 3 4 cm.

We read 2 a cm as two and seven-tenth centimeters, and 3 4 cm


## as three and two-tenth centimeters.

Can you explain why the unit was divided into smaller parts to measure the screws?

Measure the following objects using a scale and write their measurements in centimeters (as shown earlier for the lengths of the screws): pen, sharpener, and any other object of your choice.

(?) Write the measurements of the objects shown in the picture:

So, there are (2 + 3) units and (7 + 6) one-tenths. Together, they make 5 units and 13 one-tenths. But 13 one-tenths is 1 unit and 3 one-tenths. So, the total length is 6 units and 3 one-tenths.

## A Peek Beyond the Point

Can we not split a unit into 4 equal parts, 5 equal parts, 8 equal parts, or any other number of equal parts instead?

Yes, we can. The example below 6 EE

compares how the same length is 4 represented when the unit is split into 10 equal parts and when the unit is split into 4 equal parts.

If an even more precise measure is needed, each quarter can further be split into four equal parts. Each

part then measures + of a unit, i.e.,

16 such parts make 1 unit.

?) Then why split a unit into 10 parts every time?

The reason is the special role that 10 plays in the Indian place value system. For a whole number written in the Indian place value system — for example, 281—the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is tens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger than the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is 10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left:

10 ones make 1 ten,

10 tens make 1 hundred,

10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on.

x 10 x 10 x10 x10 OS +10 +10 +10 +10

In order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities smaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts. What does this give? It gives one-tenth. Further dividing it into 10 parts gives one-hundredth, and so on.

This way of writing numbers is called the “decimal system” since it is based on the number 10; “decem” means ten in Latin, which in turn is cognate to the Sanskrit dasha meaning 10, with similar words for 10 occurring across many Indian languages including Odia, Konkani, Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Bodo, and Assamese. We shall learn about other ways of writing numbers in later grades.

How Big? We already know that a hundred 10s make 1000, and a hundred 100s make 10000.

?) We can ask similar questions about fractional parts:

(a) How many thousandths make one unit?

(b) How many thousandths make one tenth?

(c) How many thousandths make one hundredth? (d) How many tenths make one ten?

(e) How many hundredths make one ten?

?) Make a few more questions of this kind and answer them.


## Notation, Writing and Reading of Numbers

We have been writing numbers in a particular way, say 456, instead of writing them as 4 x 100 (4 hundreds) + 5 x 10 (5 tens) + 6 x 1 (6 ones).

Similarly, can we “ writing tenths and hundredths? ©

Math Can the quantity az 9 be written as 42 (skipping the pin 2x 4) ?

If yes, how ould we know if 42 means 4 tens and ” units or it means 4 units and 2 tenths? Similarly, 705 could mean:

(a) 7 hundreds, and 0 tens and 5 ones (700 + 0 + 5)


## (b) 7 tens and 0 units and 5 tenths (70 +O+ 3)

## 7 hundreds and 5 ones 705 (700 +0 +5)


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Since these are different quantities, we need to have distinct ways

of writing them.

To identify the place value where integers end and the fractional

parts start, we use a point or period (‘.’) as a separator, called a decimal point.

The above quantities in decimal notation are then:

7 tens and 5 tenths (70 +O0+ 3) 70.5 7 units and 5 hundredths 5 7.05 (7 0% it0)

These numbers, when shown through place value, are as follows:

Thus decimal notation is a natural extension of the Indian place value system to numbers also having fractional parts. Just as 705 means 7x 100+5 x 1, the number 70.5 means 7 x 10 +5 x a , and 7.05 means 7x1+5*x LL

100°

We have seen how to write numbers using the decimal point (‘.’). But how do we read/say these numbers?

We know that 705 is read as seven hundred and five.

70.5 is read as seventy point five, short for seventy and five-tenths.

7.05 is read as seven point zero five, short for seven and five hundredths.

0.274 is read as zero point two seven four. We don’t read it as zero point two hundred and seventy four as 0.274 means 2 one-tenths and 7 one-hundredths and 4 one-thousandths.

?) Make a place value table similar to the one above. Write each quantity

in decimal form and in terms of place value, and read the number:

(a) 2 ones, 3 tenths and 5 hundredths (b) 1ten and 5 tenths

## Estimating Sums and Differences

Sonu has observed sums and differences of decimal numbers and says, “If we add two decimal numbers, then the sum will always be greater than the sum of their whole number parts. Also, the sum will always be less than 2 more than the sum of their whole number parts.”

Let us use an example to understand what his claim means:

If the two numbers to be added are 25.936 and 8.202, the claim is that their sum will be greater than 25 + 8 (whole number parts) and will be less than 25 +1+8+1.

¢ In2013, the finance office of Amsterdam City Council (Netherlands) mistakenly sent out €188 million in housing benefits instead of the intended €1.8 million due to a programming error that processed payments in euro cents instead of euros. (1 euro-cent = 1/100 euro).

¢ In1983,a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada Boeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300 pounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1 pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield. Fortunately, everyone survived.

Several incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal numbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5 mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the location of the decimal point.


## Deceptive Decimal Notation

Sarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post noon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.?

of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10 equal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60 minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach the station at 4:30.

Here is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width of an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches (since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully.

In the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and Christopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period (‘”) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while Francois Viéte, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead.

Currently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer part and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5 is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal point has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers having fractional parts in the Indian place value system.

EXPRESSIONS USING LETTER- #25 NUMBERS ~


## 4.1 The Notion of Letter-Numbers

In this chapter we shalllook ata concise way of expressing mathematical relations and patterns. We shall see how this helps us in thinking about these relationships and patterns, and in explaining why they may hold true.

Example 1: Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab. When Aftab’s age 10 years, Shabnam’s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab’s age is 18 years, what will Shabnam’s age be?

?) Given Aftab’s age, how will you find out Shabnam’s age? Easy: We add 3 to Aftab’s age to get Shabnam’s age. ?) Can we write this as an expression?

Shabnam’s age is 3 years more than Aftah’s. In short, this can be written as:

Shabnam’s age = Aftah’s age + 3.

Such mathematical relations are Aftabs Expression for generally represented in a shorthand age Shabnam’s age form. In the relation above, instead 4 443 of writing the phrase ‘Aftab’s Age’,

the convention is to use a convenient 0 0 + 3


## symbol. Usually, letters or short phrases 23 23 + 3

are used for this purpose. ? 743 Let us say we use the letter a to

denote Aftab’s age (we could have a ar 3

used any other letter), and s to denote Fig. 4.1

Shabnam’s age. Then the expression to find Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as

S=at3. If a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age?

Chapter-4.indd 81 4/11/2025 7:30:05 PM


## Chapter-4.indd 82


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Replacing a by 23 in the expression a + 3, we get, s = 23 + 3 = 26 years.

Letters such as aand s that are used to represent numbers are called letter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers, such as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions.

(?) Given the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab’s age.

We know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab’s age will be 3 less than Shabnam’s. This can be described as

Aftab’s age = Shabnam’s age - 3. If we again use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age and the letter s

to denote Shabnam’s age, then the algebraic expression would be: a=s-—3, meaning 3 less than s.

(?) Use this expression to find Aftah’s age if Shabnam’s age is 20.

Example 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns. He repeatedly places Ls next to each other. Each L has two matchsticks as shown in Figure 4.2.

Fig. 4.2

How many matchsticks are needed to make 5 Ls? It will be 5 x 2.

How many matchsticks are needed to make 7 Ls? It will be 7 x 2.

How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 x 2.

Now, what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number


## of sticks?

First, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L needs 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2 times the number of L’s. This can be written as:

Number of matchsticks = 2 x Number of L’s

Now, we can use any letter to denote the number of L’s. Let’s use n. The algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be:


## 2xn.

This expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make n Ls. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the number of L.

Cost of 10 coconuts = 10 x $35 Cost of 5 kg jaggery = 5 x 760 Total cost = 10 x $35 + 5 x $60 = $350 + $300 = 650.

(©) How much should she pay if she buys 8 coconuts and 9 kg jaggery?

(©) Write an algebraic expression to find the total amount to be paid for a

given number of coconuts and quantity of jaggery.

Let us identify the relationships and then write the expressions.


## Quantity needed Relationship Expression


## Cost of coconuts Number of cx 35 coconuts x 35


## Number of kgs of jaggery x 60


## Cost of jaggery


## jx 60

Here, ‘c’ represents the number of coconuts and 7’ represents the number of kgs of jaggery. The total amount to be paid will be:

Cost of coconuts + Cost of jaggery. The corresponding algebraic expression can be written as: cx 35+jx 60

?) Use this expression (or formula) to find the total amount to be paid for


## 7 coconuts and 4 kg jaggery.

Notice that for different values of ‘c’ and 7’, the value of the expression also changes. Writing this expression as a sum of terms we get:

?) Example 4: We are familiar with calculating the perimeters of simple

## 4.2 Revisiting Arithmetic Expressions

We learnt to write expressions as sums of terms and it became easy for us to read arithmetic expressions. Many times they could have been read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping (adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers by grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating expressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of the expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including brackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive property (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples).

Let us revise these concepts and find the values of the following expressions:

1. 23-102 2. 83+ 28-13 + 32 3. 34-14+ 20 4. 42+15-(8-7) 5. 68-(18 + 13) 6. 7x4+9x6

7 20 + 8 x (16 - 6)

Let us evaluate the first expression, 23 - 10 x 2. First we shall write the terms of the expression. Notice that one of the terms is a number, while the other one has to be converted to a number before adding the two terms.

23-10 2=23+-10 x 2=23+-20=3

(:) VJ

## Chapter-4.indd 86


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Let us now evaluate the second one. All the terms of this expression are numbers. If we notice the terms, we find that it will be easier to evaluate if we swap and group the terms.

83 + 28-13 + 32=

Let us now look at the fifth expression. It has brackets with a negative sign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways — by solving the bracket first (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets appropriately (as on the right side).

. 708 +18) ” ° . 31 OR i

Now, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions.

Algebraic expressions also take number values when the letter- numbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for finding Shabnam’s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the letter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26.


## 4.3 Omission of the Multiplication Symbol in Algebraic Expressions

Look at this number sequence: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...

How can we describe this sequence or pattern? Easy: These are the numbers appearing in the multiplication table of 4 (multiples of 4 in an increasing order).

What is the third term of this sequence? It is 4 x 3.

What is the 29th term of this sequence? It is 4 x 29.

?) Find an algebraic expression to get the nth term of this sequence.

Note that here ‘n’ is a letter-number that denotes a position in the sequence.


## Gc.) VW

## Chapter-4.indd 87


## Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

As it is the sequence of multiples of 4, it can be seen that the nth term

will be 4 times n: 4xn

As a standard practice, we shorten 4 x n to 4n by skipping the multiplication sign. We write the number first, followed by the letter(s). Find the value of the expression 7k when k = 4. The value is 7 x 4 = 28.

Find the value that the expression 5m + 3 takes when m = 2.

As 5m stands for 5 x m, the value of the expression when m = 2 is 5x 2+3=13.

Mind the Mistake, Mend the Mistake Some simplifications are shown below where the letter-numbers are replaced by numbers and the value of the expression is obtained.

1. Observe each of them and identify if there is a mistake.

2. If you think there is a mistake, try to explain what might have gone wrong.

3. Then, correct it and give the value of the expression.

Ifa=-4, Ifd=6, Ifs=7, then 10-a=6. then 3d = 36. then 3s-2= 15.

## a 4.4 Simplification of Algebraic Expressions

Earlier we found expressions to find perimeters of different regular figures in terms of their sides. Let us now find an expression to find the perimeter of a rectangle.


## Gy VW

## Chapter-4.indd 88


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Asin the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter when the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known:


## Find the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth.

Let us use the letter-numbers | and b in place of length and breadth respectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have p=l+b+l+b

As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an expression can be added in any order. Hence the above expression can be written as:


## =l+l+b+b

Asl+l=2x1l=2l,andb+b=2 x b= 2b, we have

p= 21+ 2b.

Notice that the initial expression (1+ b + 1+ b) and the final expression (21 + 2b) that we got for the perimeter look different. However, they are equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by applying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are equal in the sense that they both take the same values when letter-

numbers are replaced by numbers. For example, if we assign I = 3, b = 4, we get

l+b+1l+b=3+4+3+4=14, and 21+ 2b=2x3+2x4=14, We call the expression 21 + 2b the simplified form of 1+ b+1+b. Let us see some more examples of simplification.

Example 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers sold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d. Find the total money earned by the shopkeeper during these three days.


## Pencils (Price ‘c’)


## Erasers (Price ‘d’)

Let us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils. The money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c. Similarly, the money earned by selling pencils on Day 2is___—, and Day 3 is . The total money earned by the sale of pencils is 5c + 3c + 10c. Can we simplify this expression further and reduce the number of terms?

## Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

The expression means 5 times c is added to 3 times c is added to 10 times c. So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This is what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus,

5xc+3xc+10xc=(5+3+10)xc (5 + 3+ 10) x ccan be simplified to 18 x c = 18c.

?) If c = %50, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils.

Write the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers. Then, simplify the expression.

The expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and erasers during these three days is 18c + 11d.

?) Can the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further?

There is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains different letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form.

In this problem, we saw the expression 5c + 3c + 10c getting simplified to the expression 18c.

Check that both expressions take the same value when c is replaced by different numbers.

Example 6: A big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown. Write an expression describing the area of the bigger rectangle.

Another way of seeing


## the distributive v property.

< >< > 4 3

The areas of the smaller rectangles are 4v sq. units and 3v sq. units.

The area of the bigger rectangle can be found in two ways: (i) by directly using its side lengths v and (4 + 3), or (ii) by adding the areas of the smaller rectangles.

The first way gives 7v, and the second way gives 4v + 3v. We know that they are equal: 4v + 3v = 7v, and this is the required expression for the area of the bigger rectangle.

As earlier, a big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown below. Write an expression to find the area of the rectangle AEFD.

4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Even in this case, the area of rectangle AEFD can be found in two ways: (i) by directly using the side lengths n and (12 - 4), or (ii) subtracting the area of the rectangle EBCF from that of ABCD.

D F 4 c <————

€ > A 12 E B

The first method gives us 8n, and the second method gives us 12n-4n, and they are equal, since 12n - 4n = 8n. This is the expression for the area of the rectangle AEFD.

Sets of terms such as (5c, c, 10c), (12n, — 4n) that involve the same letter-numbers are called like terms. Sets of terms such as {18c, 11d} are called unlike terms as they have different letter-numbers.

As we have seen, like terms can be added together and simplified into a single term.

?) Example 7: A shop rents out chairs Item Amount and tables for a day’s use. To rent them, one has to first pay the following amount per piece.

When the furniture is returned, the Amount shopkeeper pays back some amount returned as follows.


## Write an expression for the total

number of rupees paid if x chairs and 10 y tables are rented.

For x chairs and y tables, let us find the total amount paid at the beginning and the amount one gets back after returning the furniture.

?) Describe the procedure to get these amounts.

The total amount in rupees paid at the beginning is 40x + 75y, and the total amount returned is 6x + 10y. So, the total amount paid = (40x + 75y) — (6x + 10y).

a. ?) Can we simplify this expression? If yes, how? If not, why not?

## Chapter-4.indd 91


## Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

Recalling how we open brackets in an arithmetic expression, we get (40x + 75y) — (6x + 10y) = (40x + 75y) - 6x - 10y

Since the terms can be added in any order, the remaining bracket can be opened and the expression becomes 40x + 75y + -— 6x + - 10y We can group the like terms together, This results in

40x +-6x + 75y +-10y = (40 - 6)x + (75 - 10)y

= 34x + 65y.

The expression (40x + 75y) — (6x + 10y) is simplified to 34x + 65y, which is the total amount paid in rupees.

in the three rounds are 7p — 3q, 8p — 4q, and 6p — 2q. Here, p represents the score for a correct answer and q represents the penalty for an incorrect answer.

?) What do each of the expressions mean?

If the score for a correct answer is 4 (p = 4) and the penalty for a wrong answer is 1 (q = 1), find Charu’s score in the first round.

Charu’s score is 7 x 4-3 x 1. We can evaluate this expression by writing it as a sum of terms.

7x4-3x1=7x4+-3x1=28+-3=25

What are her scores in the second and third rounds?

What if there is no penalty? What will be the value of q in that situation?

What is her final score after the three rounds?

Her final score will be the sum of the three scores:

(7p — 3q) + (8p — 4q) + (6p - 2q).

Since the terms can be added in any order, we can remove the brackets and write

7p +—3q+ 8p +-—4q + 6p + -2q

= 7p + 8p + 6p + - (3q) + - (4q) +-(2q) (by swapping and grouping)

=(7+8+6)p+-(3+4+ 2)q

=21p+-9q

= 21p - 9q.

Charu’s total score after three rounds is 21p — 9q. Her friend Krishita’s score after three rounds is 23p — 7q.

## 4.5 Pick Patterns and Reveal Relationships

In the first section we got a glimpse of algebraic expressions and how to use them to describe simple patterns and relationships in a concise and elegant manner. Here, we continue to look for general relationships between quantities in different scenarios, find patterns and, interestingly, even explain why these patterns occur.

Remember the importance of describing in simple language, or visualising mathematical relationships, before trying to write them as expressions.

## Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

Let us start with design C. It appears for the first time at position 3, the second time at position 6.

?) Where would design C appear for the n® time?

We can see that this design appears in positions that are multiples of 3. So the n™ occurrence of Design C will be at position 3n.

?) Similarly, find the formula that gives the position where the other

Designs appear for the n® time.

The positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on.

We can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one less than the position at which Design C appears for the n" time. Thus, the nth occurrence of Design B is at position:

3n-1

Similarly, the expression describing the position at which the design A appears for the nth time is: 3n - 2.

?) Given a position number can we find out the design that appears there?


## Which Design appears at Position 122?

If the position is a multiple of 3, then clearly we have Design C. As seen earlier, if the position is one less than a multiple of 3, it has Design B, and if it is 2 less than a multiple of 3, then it has Design A.

?) Can the remainder obtained by dividing the position number by 3 be

used for this? Observe the table below.

Let us take the marked 2 x 2 square, and consider the numbers lying on the diagonals; 12 and 20; 13 and 19. Find their sums; 12 + 20, 13 + 19. What do you observe?

They are equal.

Let us extend the numbers in the calendar beyond 30, creating endless rows.

## Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun

Will the diagonal sums be equal in every 2 x 2 square in this endless grid? How can we be sure?

To be sure of this we cannot check with all 2 x 2 squares as there are an unlimited number of them.

Let us consider a 2 x 2 square. Its top left number can be any number. Let us call it ‘a’.

Given that we know the top left number, how do we find the other numbers in this 2 x 2 square?

As we have been doing, first let us describe the other numbers in words.

## Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

¢ the number to the right of ‘a’ will be 1 more than it. ¢ the number below ‘a’ will be 7 more than it. ¢ the number diagonal to ‘a’ will be 8 more than it.

So the other numbers in the 2 x 2 square can be represented as shown in the grid. Let us find the diagonal sums; a + (a + 8), and (a+ 1) + (a+ 7).

Let us simplify them.

Since the terms can be added in any order, the brackets can be opened.

at+(a+8)=at+a+8=2a+8

(a+1)+(a+7)=a+1+a+7=at+a+1+7=2a+8

We see that both diagonal sums are equal to 2a + 8 (8 more than 2 times a).

?) Verify this expression for diagonal sums by considering any 2 x 2 square and taking its top left number to be ‘a’.

Thus, we have shown that diagonal sums are equal for any value of a, i.e., for any 2 x 2 square!

, This problem is an example that shows the power of algebraic modelling in verifying whether a pattern will always hold.

Consider a set of numbers from the calendar (having endless rows) forming under the following shape:

?) Find the sum of all the numbers. Compare it with the number in the centre: 15. Repeat this for another set of numbers that forms this shape. What do you observe?

We see that the total sum is always 5 times the number in the centre.

What could be an expression describing the rule/formula to find out the number of matchsticks at any step?

The pattern is such that in Step 10, nine 2s and an added 3 (3 + 2 x 9) gives the number of matchsticks; in Step 11, ten 2s and an added 3 (3 + 2 x 10) gives the number of matchsticks. For step y, what is the expression?

It is: one less than y (i.e. y- 1) 2s anda 3. Therefore, the expression is 3+2x(y-1). This expression gives the number of matchsticks in Step y. Now we can find the number of matchsticks at any step quickly. You might have already noticed that there is a 2 in the first step also, 3 = 1+ 2. Using this, the expression we get is

ay +1. ?) Does the above expression also give the number of matchsticks at each step correctly? Are these expressions the same? We can check by simplifying the expression 3 + 2 x (y- 1). 3+2x(y-1)=3+2y-2 =2y+1.

Both expressions are the same. There is a different way to count, or see the pattern. Let us take a look at the picture again.

## 5.1 Across the Line

Take a piece of square paper and fold it in different ways. Now, on the creases formed by the folds, draw lines using a pencil and a scale. You will notice different lines on the paper. Take any pair of lines and observe their relationship with each other. Do they meet? If they do not meet within the paper, do you think they would meet if they were extended beyond the paper?

In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between lines on a plane surface. The table top, your piece of paper, the blackboard, and the bulletin board are all examples of plane surfaces.

Let us observe a pair of lines that meet each other. You will notice that they meet at a point. When a pair of lines meet each other at a point on a plane surface, we say that the lines intersect each other. Let us observe what happens when two lines intersect.

?) How many angles do they form?

In Fig. 5.2, where line ! intersects line m, we can see that four angles are formed.

## Chapter-5.indd 107


## Parallel and Intersecting Lines

Fig. 5.2

?) Can two straight lines intersect at more than one point?


## Activity 1

Draw two lines ona plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure the four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of intersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of intersection.

?) What patterns do you observe among these angles?

?) In Fig. 5.2, if Za is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of 2b, Zc

and Zd, without drawing and measuring them?

We know that Za and 2b together measure 180°, because when they are combined, they form a straight angle which measures 180°. So, if Za is 120°, then 2b must be 60°.

Similarly, 7b and Zc together measure 180°. So, if 2b is 60°, then Zc must be 120°. And Zc and /d together measure 180°. So, if Zc is 120°, then 4d must be 60°.

Therefore, in Fig. 5.2, Za and Zc measure 120°, and 4b and 4d measure 60°.

When two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled a, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then Za and Zc are equal, and 7b and 4d are equal!

?) Is this always true for any pair of intersecting lines?

Check this for different measures of Za. Using these measurements, can you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of /a?

We can generalise our reasoning for Fig. 5.2, without assuming the values of Za.

Since straight angles measure 180°, we must have Za+ Zb= Za+ Zd

= 180°. Hence, 2b and 2d are always equal. Similarly, 7b + Za= Zb+

ZC = 180°, so Za and Zc must be equal.

Adjacent angles, like Za and 2b, formed by two lines intersecting each other, are called linear pairs. Linear pairs always add up to 180°.

4/11/2025 7:30:37 PM


## Chapter-5.indd 108


## (©) Figure it Out


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Opposite angles, like 7b and Zd, formed by two lines intersecting each other, are called vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite angles are always equal to each other.

From the above reasoning, we conclude that whenever two lines intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. Such a justification is called a proof in mathematics.

List all the linear pairs and vertically opposite angles you observe in Fig. 5.3:


## Linear Pairs Zaand ZD, ...


## Pairs of Vertically Opposite Angles


## Zb and Za, ...

Fig. 5.3


## Measurements and Geometry

You might have noticed that when you measure linear pairs, sometimes they may not add up to 180°. Or, when you measure vertically opposite angles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this? There could be different reasons:

¢ Measurement errors because of improper use of measuring instruments — in this case, a protractor

¢ Variation in the thickness of the lines drawn. The “ideal” line in geometry does not have any thickness! But it is not possible for us to draw lines without any thickness In geometry, we create ideal versions of “lines” and other shapes we see around us, and analyse the relationships between them. For example, we know that the angle formed by a straight line is 180°. So, if another line divides this angle into two parts, both parts should add up to 180°. We arrive at this simply through reasoning and not by measurement. When we measure, it might not be exactly so, for the reasons mentioned above. Still the measurements come out very close to what we predict, because of which geometry finds widespread application in different disciplines such as physics, art, engineering and architecture.


## 5.2 Perpendicular Lines

equal? Can you figure out what will be the measure of each angle?

## Parallel and Intersecting Lines

Fig. 5.4

If two lines intersect and all four angles are equal, then each angle must be a right angle (90°).

Perpendicular lines are a pair of lines which intersect each other at right angles (90°). In Fig. 5.4, we can say that lines | and m are perpendicular to each other.


## 5.3 Between Lines

Observe Fig. 5.5 and describe the way the line segments meet or cross each other in each case, with appropriate mathematical words (a point, an endpoint, the midpoint, meet, intersect) and the degree measure of each angle.

For example, line segments FG and FH meet at the endpoint F at an

## 5.5 Transversals

We saw what happens when two lines intersect in different ways. Let us explore what happens when one line intersects two different lines.

t Fig. 5.14

In Fig. 5.14, line t intersects lines | and m. t is called a transversal. Notice that 8 angles are formed when a line crosses a pair of lines.

?) Is it possible for all the eight angles to have different measurements?


## Why, why not?

?) What about five different angles —6, 5, 4, 3 and 2?

In Fig. 5.14, since 71 and 23 are vertically opposite angles, they are equal. Are there other pairs of vertically opposite angles? We can see that there are a total of four pairs of vertically opposite angles and in each pair, the angles are equal to each other.

Thus, when a transversal intersects two lines, it forms eight angles with a maximum of four distinct angle measures.


## 5.6 Corresponding Angles

In Fig. 5.14, we notice that the transversal t forms two sets of angles — one with line / and another with line m. There are angles in the first set that correspond to angles in the second set based on their position. 71 and 45 are called corresponding angles. Similarly, 72 and 26, 73 and Z7, Z4 and Z8 are the corresponding angles formed when transversal t intersects lines 1 and m.

t Fig. 5.15

Step 2: Measure Za formed by lines / and t (let us say it is 60°).

Fig. 5.16

How many distinct angles have formed now?

If one angle is 60°, the other angle of the linear pair should be 120°. So, we already have two distinct angles.

So, when we draw another line intersecting the transversal t we wish to form only two angles, 60° and 120°.


## Step 3: Mark a point Y on line ¢.

Fig. 5.17

Step 4: Draw a line m through point Y that forms a 60° angle to line t. This can be done either by copying 4a with a tracing paper or you can use a protractor to measure the angles.

Fig. 5.18

What do you observe about lines | and m? Do they appear to be parallel to each other?

Yes, they do appear to be parallel to each other.

Angles, Zaand 4b are corresponding angles formed by the transversal ton lines land m. These corresponding angles are equal to each other.

## Parallel and Intersecting Lines

From this we can observe:

When the corresponding angles formed by a transversal on a pair of lines are equal to each other, then the pair of lines are parallel to each other.

Suppose, we have a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. What can be said about the corresponding angles?


## (?) Activity 4

Fig. 5.19 has a pair of parallel lines / and m (what is the notation used in the figure to indicate they are parallel?) . Line t is the transversal across these two lines. Za and 2b are corresponding angles. Take a tracing paper and trace Za on it. Now place this tracing paper over Zb and see if the angles align exactly. You will observe that the angles match. Check the other corresponding angles in the figure using a protractor. Are all the corresponding angles equal to each other?

Fig. 5.19

Corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair of parallel lines are always equal to each other.

(?) Activity 5 In Fig. 5.20, draw a transversal t to the lines 1 and m such that one pair of corresponding angles is equal. You can measure the angles with a

protractor. ee —,

When a pair of lines are not parallel to each other, the corresponding angles formed by a transversal can never be equal to each other.


## 5.7 Drawing Parallel Lines

Can you draw a pair of parallel lines using a ruler and a set square?

Fig. 5.21 shows how you can do it.

Draw a line | with a scale. By sliding your set square you can make two lines perpendicular to line l.

Are these two lines parallel to each other? How are we sure that they are parallel to each other? What angles are formed between these lines and line I?

Fig. 5.21

Since we used a set square, the angles measure 90°. The position of the lines is different, but they make the same angle with L. If line 1 is seen as a transversal to the two new lines, then the corresponding angles measure 90°.


## l

Fig. 5.22

As we know these are corresponding angles and they are equal, we can be sure that the lines are parallel.

Draw two more parallel lines using the long side of the set square as shown in Fig. 5.22.

## Parallel and Intersecting Lines

How do you know these two lines are parallel? Can you check if the corresponding angles are equal?

Note to the Teacher: Students should be encouraged to check the equality of corresponding angles both by using the tracing method and using protractors to measure the angles. Pay attention to the language used to make the relationship between corresponding angles and parallel lines. Equality of corresponding angles is both necessary and sufficient for the pair of lines to be parallel to each other.

## Making Parallel Lines through Paper Folding

Let us try to do the same with paper folding. For a line / (given as a crease), how do we make a line parallel to / such that it passes through point A?

We know how to fold a piece of paper to get a line perpendicular to l. Now, try to fold a perpendicular to / such that it passes through point A. Let us call this new crease t.

Now, fold a line perpendicular to t passing through A again. Let us call this line m. The lines 1 and m are parallel to each other.

## 5.8 Alternate Angles

In Fig. 5.25, Zdis called the alternate angle of 7f, and /cis the alternate angle of Ze.

Fig. 5.25

You can find the alternate angle of a given angle, say Zf, by first finding the corresponding angle of Zf, which is 7b and then finding the vertically opposite angle of 2b, which is 2d.


## (?) Activity 6

In Fig. 5.25, if Zfis 120° what is the measure of its alternate angle 7d?

We can find the measure of 4d if we know Zb because they are vertically opposite angles. Remember, vertically opposite angles are equal.

What is the measure of 2b? It is 120° because it is the corresponding angle of Zf.

So, Zd also measures 120°.

In fact, 7f= Zb irrespective of the measure of Zf. Why? Because 2b is the corresponding angle of 7.

Similarly, 7b = 2d irrespective of the measure of 7b. Why? Because Zd is the vertically opposite angle of 2b. So, it must always be the case that


## Lf= Za

Using our understanding of corresponding angles without any measurements, we have justified that alternate angles are always equal.

Alternate angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair of parallel lines are always equal to each other.

?) Example 1: In Fig. 5.26, parallel lines 1 and m are intersected by the

transversal t. If 76 is 135°, what are the measures of the other angles?

4/11/2025 7:30:40 PM


## Chapter-5.indd 121


## Parallel and Intersecting Lines

Fig. 5.26

Solution: 26 is 135°, so 22 is also 135°, because it is the corresponding angle of 26 and the lines / and m are parallel.

Z8 is 135°, because it is the vertically opposite angle of 76. 74 is 135° because it is the corresponding angle of 28.

Z2 is 135° because is the vertically opposite angle of 24. So, 22, 24, Z6, and 48 are all 135°.

Z5 and 46 are a linear pair, together they measure 180°. If 46 is 135°, then

Z5 = 180 - 135 = 45°

We can similarly find out that 71, 73, and 77 measure 45°.

?) Example 2: In Fig. 5.27, lines land m are intersected by the transversal

t. If Za is 120° and Zfis 70°, are lines 1 and m parallel to each other?

Fig. 5.27

Solution: Za is 120°, so 2b is 60° because Za and 4b form a linear pair. Zb is a corresponding angle of Zf If 1 and mare parallel, 7b should be equal to Zf, however, they are not equal.

Therefore, lines and mare not parallel to each other as the corresponding angles formed by the transversal t are not equal to each other.

?) Example 3: In Fig. 5.28, parallel lines | and m are intersected by the

transversal t. If 23 is 50°, what is the measure of 76?


## VJ

4/11/2025 7:30:40 PM


## Chapter-5.indd 122


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Solution: 73 is 50°; therefore, 72 is 130°, because 42 and 43 form a linear pair, and linear pairs always add up to 180°.

Z2and 46 are corresponding angles, and they need to be equal since lines [and mare parallel.

So, 26 is 130°.

Angles 73 and 46 are called interior angles.

Is there a relation between 23 and 46? You could try to find the relationship by taking different values for 73 and see what 46 is. Once you find a relation, try to justify it or prove that this relation holds always. You will find that the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal always add up to 180°.

?) Example 4: In Fig. 5.29, line segment AB is parallel to CD and AD is

parallel to BC. ZDAC is 65° and ZADC is 60°. What are the measures of angles ZCAB, ZABC, and ZBCD?

Solution: Let us observe the parallel lines AB and CD. AD is a transversal of these two lines.

Fig. 5.29

We know that the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal on a pair of parallel lines adds up to 180°. So

ZADC + ZDAB = 180°

60° + ZDAB = 180°.


## So ZDAB = 120°.

Can we find ZCAB from this?

ZDAB = ZDAC + ZCAB.

So 120° = 65° + ZCAB.


## So ZCAB = 55°.

Let us observe the parallel line segments AD and BC. They are intersected by a transversal CD. So, ZADC + ZBCD = 180°, because they are interior angles on the same side of the transversal. Since ZADC is given as 60°, ZBCD = 120°

Similarly, we find ZABC = 60°.

Therefore, in Fig. 5.29, ZCAB = 55°, ZABC = 60°, and ZBCD = 120°.

ee SUMMARY }--------2------2---------

When two lines intersect, they form four angles. The vertically opposite angles are equal and the linear pairs add up to 180°.

When two lines intersect and the angles formed are 90° (i.e., all four angles are equal), the lines are said to be perpendicular to each other. When two lines never intersect on a plane, they are called parallel lines.

When a line t intersects another pair of lines, it is called a transversal and it forms 2 sets of 4 angles. Each of the 4 angles in the first set has a corresponding angle in the second set.

When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal. When a transversal intersects a pair of lines and the corresponding angles are equal, then the pair of lines is parallel.

When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the alternate angles are equal.

The interior angles on the same side formed by a transversal intersecting a pair of parallel lines always add up to 180°.

## 6.2 Picking Parity

to do it? Seog. m-s=


## ebteecen

Can you figure out which 5 cards add to 30? Is it possible?

There are many ways of choosing 5 cards from this collection.

Is there a way to find a solution without checking all possibilities? Let us find out.

?) Add a few even numbers together. What kind of number do you get?

Does it matter how many numbers are added?

Any even number can be arranged in pairs without any leftovers. Some even numbers are shown here, arranged in pairs.

As we see in the figure, adding any number of even numbers

will result in a number which can still be arranged in pairs without any leftovers. In other words, the sum will always be an even number.

Now, add a few odd numbers together. What kind of number do you get? Does it matter how many odd numbers are added?

Odd numbers can not be arranged in pairs. An odd number is one more than a collection of pairs. Some odd numbers are shown below:


## VW

Can we also think of an odd number as one less than a collection of pairs?

This figure shows that the sum of two odd numbers must always ee be even! This along with the other figures here are more examples @@ of a proof!

We can see that two odd numbers added together can always be arranged in pairs.

?) What about adding 3 odd numbers? Can the resulting sum be arranged in pairs? No.

?) Explore what happens to the sum of (a) 4 odd numbers, (b) 5 odd numbers, and (c) 6 odd numbers.

Let us go back to the puzzle Kishor was trying to solve. There are 5 empty boxes. That means he has an odd number of boxes. All the number cards contain odd numbers.

They should add to 30, which is an even number. Since, adding any 5 odd numbers will never result in an even number, Kishor cannot arrange these cards in the boxes to add up to 30.

?) Two siblings, Martin and Maria, were born exactly one year apart. Today they are celebrating their birthday. Maria exclaims that the sum of their ages is 112. Is this possible? Why or why not?

As they were born one year apart, their ages will be (two) consecutive numbers. Can their ages be 51 and 52? 51 + 52 = 103. Try some other consecutive numbers and see if their sum is 112.

The counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... alternate between even and odd numbers. In any two consecutive numbers, one will always be even and the other will always be odd!

What would be the resulting sum of an even number and an odd number? We can see that their sum can’t be arranged in pairs and thus will be an odd number.

## Number Play

Since 112 is an even number, and Martin’s and Maria’s ages are consecutive numbers, they cannot add up to 112. We use the word parity to denote the property of being even or odd. For instance, the parity of the sum of any two consecutive numbers is odd. Similarly, the parity of the sum of any two odd numbers is even. (©) Figure it Out

1. Using your understanding of the pictorial representation of odd and even numbers, find out the parity of the following sums:

?) What is the 100th even number?

This is 2 x 100 = 200.

Does this help in finding the 100th odd number? Let us compare the sequence of evens and odds term-by-term.

Even Numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...

Odd Numbers: 1, 3,5, 7, 9, 11,...

We see that at any position, the value at the odd number sequence is one less than that in the even number sequence. Thus, the 100th odd number is 200 - 1 = 199.

?) Write a formula to find the n™ odd number. Let us first describe the method that we have learnt to find the odd number at a given position:

(a) Find the even number at that position. This is 2 times the position number.

(b) Then subtract 1 from the even number. Writing this in expressions, we get (a) 2n (b) 2n-1 Thus, 2n is the formula that gives the n even number, and 2n - 1 is the formula that gives the n odd number.

The numbers in the yellow circles are the sums of the corresponding rows and columns. Fill the grids below based on the rule mentioned above:

## Chapter-6.indd 134


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Make a couple of questions like this on your own and challenge your peers.

Try solving the problem below.

You might have realised that it is not possible to find a solution for this grid. Why is this the case?

The smallest sum possible is 6 = 1+2+3.The largest sum possible is 24 = 9 + 8+ 7. Clearly, any number in a circle cannot be less than 6 or greater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26. Therefore, this is impossible!

In the earlier grids which we solved, Kishor noticed that the sum of all the numbers in the circles was always 90. Also, Vidya observed that the sum of the circled numbers for all three rows, or for all three columns, was always 45. Check if this is true in the previous grids you have solved.

The 3 row sums added together gives 45! So does adding the column sums.

Why should the row sums and column sums always add to 45?

From this grid, we can see that all the row sums added together will be the same as the sum of the numbers 1 - 9. This can be seen for column sums as well. The sum of the numbers 1 - 9 is

1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45.

A square grid of numbers is called a magic square if each row, each column and each diagonal, add up to the same number. This number is called the magic sum. Diagonals are shown in the picture.

Trying to create a magic square by randomly filling the grid with numbers may be difficult! This is because there are a large number of ways of filling a 3 x 3 grid using the numbers 1 - 9 without repetition. In fact, it can be found that there are exactly 3,62,880 such ways. Surprisingly, the number of ways to fill in the grid can be found without listing all of them. We will see in later years how to do this.

Instead, we should proceed systematically to make a magic square. For this, let us ask ourselves some questions.

1. What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number?


## VJ

## Chapter-6.indd 135


## Number Play

Let us focus, for the moment, only on the row sums. We have seen that in a 3 x 3 grid with numbers 1 - 9, the total of row sums will always be 45. Since in a magic square the row sums are all equal, and they add up to 45, they have to be 15 each. Thus, we have the following observation.

Observation 1: In a magic square made using the numbers 1 - 9, the magic sum must be 15.

2. What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a magic square?

Let us consider the possibilities one by one. Can the central number be 9? If yes, then 8 must come in one of the other squares. For example,

In this, we must have 8 + 9 + other number = 15.

But this is not possible! The same issue will occur no matter where we place 8.

So, 9 cannot be at the centre. Can the central number be 1?

If yes, then 2 should come in one of the other squares.

Here, we must have 2 + 1 + other number = 15.

But this is not possible because we are only using the numbers 1-9. The same issue will occur no matter where we place 1.

So, 1 cannot be at the centre, either.

?) Using such reasoning, find out which other numbers 1-9 cannot occur at the centre.

This exploration will lead us to the following interesting observation.

Observation 2: The number occurring at the centre of a magic square, filled using 1 - 9, must be 5.

Let us now see where the smallest number 1 and the largest number 9 should come in a magic square. Our second observation tells us that they will have to come in one of the boundary positions. Let us classify these positions into two categories:

(=)

4/12/2025 11:59:05 AM


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Can 1 occur in a corner position? For example, can it be placed as follows?

?) If yes, then there should exist three ways of adding 1 with two other numbers to give 15. We have 1+5+9=1+6+ 8 =15. Is any other combination possible?

?) Similarly, can 9 can be placed in a corner position?

Observation 3: The numbers 1 and 9 cannot occur in any corner, so they should occur in one of the middle positions.

?) Can you find the other possible positions for 1 and 9?

Now, we have one full row or column of the magic square! Try completing it! (Hint: First fill the row or columns containing 1 and 9]

## Magic Squares in History and Culture

The first magic square ever recorded, the Lo Shu Square, dates back over 2000 years to ancient China. The legend tells of a catastrophic flood on the Lo River, during which the gods sent a turtle to save the people. The turtle carried a 3 x 3 grid on its back, with the numbers 1 to 9 arranged in a magical pattern.

Magic squares were studied in different parts of the world at different points of time including India, Japan, Central Asia, and Europe.

Indian mathematicians have worked extensively on magic squares, describing general methods of constructing them. The work of Indian mathematicians was not just limited to 3 x 3 and 4x 4 grids, which we considered above, but also extended to 5 x 5 and other larger square grids. We shall learn more about these in later grades.

The occurrence of magic squares is not limited to scholarly mathematical works. They are found in many places in India. The picture to the right is of a 3 x 3 magic square found on a pillar in a temple in Palani, Tamil Nadu. The temple dates back to the 8th century CE.

3 x 3 magic squares can also be found in homes and shops in India. The Navagraha Yantra is one such example shown below.

## 6.4 Nature’s Favourite Sequence: The Virahanka- Fibonacci Numbers!

The sequence 1, 2,3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,... (Virahanka—Fibonacci Numbers) is one of the most celebrated sequences in all of mathematics — it occurs throughout the world of Art, Science, and Mathematics. Even though these numbers are found very frequently in Science, it is remarkable that these numbers were first discovered in the context of Art (specifically, poetry)!

The Virahanka-Fibonacci Numbers thus provide a beautiful illustration of the close links between Art, Science, and Mathematics.


## Discovery of the Virahanka Numbers

The Virahanka numbers first came up thousands of years ago in the works of Sanskrit and Prakrit linguists in their study of poetry!

In the poetry of many Indian languages, including, Prakrit, Sanskrit, Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, each syllable is classified as either long or short.

A long syllable is pronounced for a longer duration than a short syllable — in fact, for exactly twice as long. When singing such a poem, a short syllable lasts one beat of time, and a long syllable lasts two beats of time.

This leads to numerous mathematical questions, which the ancient poets in these languages considered extensively. Anumber ofimportant mathematical discoveries were made in the process of asking and answering these questions about poetry.

One of these particularly important questions was the following.

How many rhythms are there with 8 beats consisting of short syllables (1 beat) and long syllables (2 beats)? That is, in how many ways can one

4/12/2025 11:59:07 AM


## Chapter-6.indd 140


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

fill 8 beats with short and long syllables, where a short syllable takes one beat of time and a long syllable takes two beats of time. Here are some possibilities:


## long long long long

short short short short short short short short short long long short long


## long long short short long

Can you find others? Phrased more mathematically: In how many different ways can one write a number, say 8, as a sum of 1’s and 2’s? For example, we have: 8=2+2+2+2, 8=14+1+1+1+14+1+1+4, 8=14+2+2+1+2, 8=2+2+1+1+2, etc. Do you see other ways? Here are all the ways of writing each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, as the sum of 1’s and 2’s.


## fo Different Ways | Number of Ways 1+1 } 1+1+1

n=3 1+2 3 2+1

1+1+1+1 1+1+2 n=4 1+2+1 5 2+1+1 2+2

Try writing the number 5 as a sum of 1s and 2s in all possible ways in your notebook! How many ways did you find? (You should find 8 different ways!) Can you figure out the answer without listing down all the possibilities? Can you try it for n = 8?

Here is a systematic way to write down all rhythms of short and long syllables having 5 beats. Write a ‘1+’ in front of all rhythms having 4 beats, and then a ‘2+’ in front of all rhythms having 3 beats. This gives us all the rhythms having 5 beats:


## Cy

1+1+1+1+1 2+1+1+1 1+1+1+2 2+1+2

1+1+2+1 2+2+1 1+2+1+1 1+2+2

Thus, there are 8 rhythms having 5 beats!

The reason this method works is that every 5-beat rhythm must begin with either a ‘1+’ or a ‘2+’. If it begins with a ‘1+’, then the remaining numbers must give a 4-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. If it begins with a 2+, then the remaining number must give a 3-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. Therefore, the number of 5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat rhythms, plus the number of 3-beat rhythms.

How many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will be the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms, ie., 8+ 5 = 13. Thus, there are 13 rhythms having 6 beats.

(©) Use the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write

6 as the sum of 1’s and 2’s in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways?

This beautiful method for counting all the rhythms of short syllables and long syllables having any given number of beats was first given by the great Prakrit scholar Virahanka around the year 700 CE. He gave his method in the form of a Prakrit poem! For this reason, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... is known as the Virahanka sequence, and the numbers in the sequence are known as the Virahanka numbers. Virahanka was the first known person in history to explicitly consider these important numbers and write down the rule for their formation.

Other scholars in India also considered these numbers in the same poetic context. Virahanka was inspired by earlier work of the legendary Sanskrit scholar Pingala, who lived around 300 BCE. After Virahanka, these numbers were also written about by Gopala (c. 1135 CE) and then by Hemachandra (c. 1150 CE).

In the West, these numbers have been known as the Fibonacci numbers, after the Italian mathematician who wrote about them in the year 1202 CE—about 500 years after Virahanka. As we can see, Fibonacci was not first, nor the second, not even the third person to write about these numbers! Sometimes the term “Virahanka-Fibonacci numbers” is used so that everyone understands what is being referred to.

So, how many rhythms of short and long syllables are there having 8 beats? We simply take the 8th element of the Virahanka sequence:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

Thus, there are 34 rhythms having 8 beats.

Today, the Virahanka-Fibonacci numbers form the basis of many mathematical and artistic theories, from poetry to drumming, to visual arts and architecture, to science. Perhaps the most stunning occurrences of these numbers are in nature. For example, the number of petals on a daisy is generally a Virahanka number.

How many petals do you see on each of these flowers?

There are many _ other remarkable mathematical properties of the Virahanka-— Fibonacci numbers that we will see later, in mathematics as well as in other subjects.

## A TALE OF THREE INTERSECTING LINES

0774CHO7

A triangle is the most basic closed shape. As we know, it consists of: * three corner points, that we call the vertex of the triangle, and

three line segments or the sides of the triangle that join the pairs of vertices. Triangles come in various shapes. Some of them are shown below.


## A B U /X Y Z B AYZX ww OA Cc


## A ABC Vv AWUV ABAU U

Observe the symbol used to denote a triangle and how the triangles are named using their vertices. While naming a triangle, the vertices can come in any order.

The three sides meeting at the corners give rise to three angles that we call the angles of the triangle. For example, in AABC, these angles are ZCAB, ZABC, ZBCA, which we simply denote as ZA, 7B and ZC, respectively.

(©) What happens when the three vertices lie on a straight line?


## 7.1 Equilateral Triangles

Among all the triangles, the equilateral triangles are the most symmetric ones. These are triangles in which all the sides are of equal lengths. Let us try constructing them.

?) Construct a triangle in which all the sides are of length 4 cm.

## A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines

How did you construct this triangle and what tools did you use? Can this construction be done only using a marked ruler (and a pencil)?

Constructing this triangle using just a ruler is certainly possible. But this might require several trials. Say we draw the base —let us call it AB — of length 4 cm (see the figure below), and mark the third point C using a ruler such that AC = 4 cm. This may not lead to BC also having a length of 4 cm. If this happens, we will have to keep making attempts to mark C till we get BC to be 4 cm long.

?) How do we make this construction more efficient?

Recall solving a similar problem in the previous year using a compass (in the Chapter ‘Playing with Constructions’). We had to mark the top point of a ‘house’ which is 5 cm from two other points. The method we used to get that point can also be used here.

After constructing AB = 4 cm, we can do the following.

Step 1: Using a compass, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 4cm from A, as shown in the figure. The point C is somewhere on this arc. How do we mark it?

7.2 Constructing a Triangle When its Sides are Given How do we construct triangles that are not equilateral? ?) Construct a triangle of sidelength 4 cm, 5 cm and 6 cm.

As in the previous case, this triangle can also be constructed using just a marked ruler. But it will involve several trials.

Like we did in the case of equilateral triangles, let us first get all the points that are at a5 cm distance from A. These points lie on the circle whose centre is A and has radius 5 cm. The point C must lie somewhere on this circle. How do we find it?

We will make use of the fact that the point C is 6 cm away from B. Construct an arc of radius 6 cm from B.

is impossible. See if you can find any pattern in them.

(?) Try to find more sets of lengths for which a triangle construction j Talk

We see that a triangle is possible for some sets of lengths and not possible for others. How do we check if a triangle exists for a given set of lengths? One way is to actually try to construct the triangle and check if it is possible. Is there a more efficient way to check this?


## Triangle Inequality

Consider the lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm. Does there exist a triangle having these as sidelengths?

To tackle this question, let us study a property of triangles. Imagine a small plot of plain land having a tent, a tree, and a pole. Imagine you are at the entrance of the tent and want to go to the tree. Which is the shorter path: (i) the straight-line path to the tree (the red path) or (ii) the straight-line path from the tent to the pole, followed by the straight-line path from the pole to the tree (the yellow path)?

4/11/2025 7:31:55 PM


## Chapter-7.indd 152


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Clearly, the direct straight-line path from the tent to the tree is shorter than the roundabout path via the pole. In fact, the direct straight-line path is the shortest possible path to the tree from the tent.

Will the direct path between any two points be shorter than the roundabout path via a third point? Clearly, the answer is yes.

(©) Can this understanding be used to tell something about the existence

of a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm?

Let us suppose that there is a triangle for this set of lengths. Remember that at this point we are not sure about the existence of the triangle but we are only supposing that it exists. Let us draw a rough diagram.

?) Is such rearrangement of lengths possible in the triangle?


## A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines

Does everything look right with this triangle?

If this triangle were possible, then the direct path between any two vertices should be shorter than the roundabout path via the third vertex. Is this true for our rough diagram?

Let us consider the paths between B and C.

Direct path length = BC = 10cm

What is the length of the roundabout path via the vertex A? It is the sum of the lengths of line segments BA and AC.

Roundabout path length = BA + AC =15 cm + 30 cm=45 cm

Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes. Let us now consider the paths between A and B.

Direct path length = AB=15 cm Finding the length of the roundabout path via the vertex C, we get Roundabout path length = AC + CB = 30cm+10cm= 40cm

Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes. Finally, consider paths between C and A.

Direct path length = CA = 30 cm Roundabout path length = CB+ BA=10 cm + 15 cm=25 cm

Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? In this case, the direct path is longer, which is absurd. Can such a triangle exist? No.

Therefore, a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm cannot exist.

We are thus able to see without construction why a triangle for the set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm cannot exist. We have been able to figure this out through spatial intuition and reasoning.

Recall how we used similar intuition and reasoning to discover properties of intersecting and parallel lines. We will continue to do this as we explore geometry.

(?) Can we say anything about the existence ofa triangle having sidelengths

3 cm, 3 cm and 7 cm? Verify your answer by construction. (?) “In the rough diagram in Fig. 7.4, is it possible to assign lengths in a different order such that the direct paths are always coming out to be shorter than the roundabout

paths? If this is possible, then a triangle might exist.”

1. We checked by construction that there are no triangles having sidelengths 3 cm, 4cm and 8 cm; and 2 cm, 3 cm and 6 cm. Check if you could have found this without trying to construct the triangle.

2. Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle for each of the following sets of lengths?

(a) 10km,10km and 25 km (b) 5mm, 10mm and 20 mm (c) 12cm, 20cm and 40 cm

You would have realised that using a rough figure and comparing the direct path lengths with their corresponding roundabout path lengths is the same as comparing each length with the sum of the other two lengths. There are three such comparisons to be made.

3. For each set of lengths seen so far, you might have noticed that in at least two of the comparisons, the direct length was less (re

than the sum of the other two (if not, check again!). For example, for the set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm, there are two |: comparisons where this happens: '

10 <15 +30

15 < 10+ 30 But this doesn’t happen for the third length: 30 > 10 + 15.

Will this always happen? That is, for any set of lengths, will there be at least two comparisons where the direct length is less than the sum of the other two? Explore for different sets of lengths.

Further, for a given set of lengths, is it possible to identify which lengths will immediately be less than the sum of the other two, without calculations?

(Hint: Consider the direct lengths in the increasing order.]

Given three sidelengths, what do we need to compare to check for the existence of a triangle?

When each length is smaller than the sum of the other two, we say that the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. For example, the set 3, 4, 5 satisfies the triangle inequality whereas, the set 10, 15, 30 does not satisfy the triangle inequality.

We have seen that lengths such as 10, 15, 30 that do not satisfy the triangle inequality cannot be the sidelengths of a triangle.

4/11/2025 7:31:56 PM

## A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines

Does a triangle exist with sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm? This satisfies the triangle inequality:

8<4+5=9

?) Why do we not need to check the other two sides?

This means that all the direct path lengths are less than the roundabout path lengths. Does this confirm the existence of a triangle?

If one of the direct path lengths had been longer, we could have concluded that a triangle would surely not exist. But in this case, we can only say that a triangle may or may not exist.

For the triangle to exist, the arcs that we construct to get the third vertex must intersect. Is it possible to determine that this will happen without actually carrying out the construction?

Visualising the construction of circles

Let us imagine that we start the construction by constructing the longest side as the base. Let AB be the base of length 8 cm. The next step is the construction of sufficiently long arcs corresponding to the other two lengths: 4 cm and 5 cm.

Instead of just constructing the arcs, let us complete the full circles. Suppose, we construct a circle of radius 4 cm with A as the centre.

(©) Now, suppose that a circle of radius 5 cm is constructed, centred at B.

Can you draw a rough diagram of the resulting figure?

Note that in the figure below, AX = 4 cm and AB = 8 cm. So, what is BX? Does this length help in visualising the resulting figure?


## VJ

4/11/2025 7:31:56 PM


## Chapter-7.indd 156


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Since BX = 4cm, and the radius of the circle centred at B is 5 cm, it is clear that the circles will intersect each other at two points.

Fig. 7.5: Circles intersecting each other at two points

What does this tell us about the existence of a triangle? The points A and B along with either of the points of intersection of the circles will give us the required triangle. Thus, there exists a triangle having sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm.


## ?) Figure it Out

1. Which of the following lengths can be the sidelengths of a triangle? Explain your answers. Note that for each set, the three lengths have the same unit of measure.

(a) 2,2,5 (b) 3,4,6 (c) 2,4,8 (d) 5,5,8 (e) 10, 20, 25 (f) 10, 20, 35

(g) 24, 26, 28

We observe from the previous problems that whenever there is a set of lengths satisfying the triangle inequality (each length < sum of the other two lengths), there is a triangle with those three lengths as sidelengths.

?) Will triangles always exist when a set of lengths satisfies the triangle inequality? How can we be sure?

We can be sure of the existence of a triangle only if we can show that the circles intersect internally (as in Fig. 7.5) whenever the triangle inequality is satisfied. But are there other possibilities when the two circles are constructed? Let us visualise and study them.

The following different cases can be conceived:

Case 1: Circles touch each other Case 2: Circles do notintersect

<>

Case 3: Circles intersect each other internally

Note that while constructing the circles, we take

(a) the length of the base AB = longest of the given length (b) the radii of the circles to be the smaller two lengths.

Which of the above-mentioned cases will lead to the formation of a

triangle? Clearly, triangles are formed only when the circles intersect each other internally (Case 3).

Let us study each of these cases by finding the relation between the radii (the smaller two lengths) and AB (longest length).

AB is composed of one radius and a part of the other. So,

sum of the two radii > AB, or sum of the two smaller lengths > longest length

?) Can we use this analysis to tell if a triangle exists when the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality?

If the given lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, then the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the longest length. This means that this will lead to Case 3 where the circles intersect internally, and so a triangle exists.

?) How will the two circles turn out for a set of lengths that do not satisfy the triangle inequality? Find 3 examples of sets of lengths for which the circles:

(a) touch each other at a point, (b) do not intersect.

## Je it J

If the two angles are greater than or equal to a right angle (90°), then it is clear that a triangle is not possible.

The blue line is the line with the least rightward bend that doesn’t meet the line ‘I’

Visually, it is clear that the line that creates the smallest 7B has to be the one parallel to l. Let us call this parallel line m.

Can you tell the actual value of 2B be in this case?

(Hint: Note that AB is the transversal.]

We have seen that when two lines are parallel, the internal angles on the same side of the transversal add up to 180°. So ZB = 140°.

So, for what values of ZB, does a triangle not exist? Does the length AB play any part here?

From the discussion above, it can be seen that the length AB does not play any part in deciding the existence of a triangle. We can say that a triangle does not exist when ZB is greater than or equal to 140°.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

When the sum of two given angles is less than 180°, a triangle exists with these angles. If the sum is greater than or equal to 180°, there is no triangle with these angles.

Let us take two angles, say 60° and 70°, whose sum is less than 180°. Let the included side be 5 cm.

(©) What could the measure of the third angle be? Does this measure

change if the base length is changed to some other value, say 7 cm? Construct and find out.

(©) In general, once the two angles are fixed, does the third angle depend

on the included sidelength? Try with different pairs of angles and lengths.

The measurements might show that the sidelength has no effect (or a very small effect) on the third angle. With this observation, let us see if we can find the third angle without carrying out the construction and measurement.

?) Try experimenting with different triangles to see if there is a

We saw that the notion of parallel lines was useful to determine that the sum of any two angles of a triangle is less than 180°. Parallel lines can be used to find the third angle, 7BAC as well.

Let us suppose we construct a line XY parallel to BC through vertex A.

Therefore, 7XAB = 50°, and ZYAC = 70°. Can we find 7BAC from this? We know that ZXAB, ZYAC and /BAC together form 180°. So

ZXAB + ZYAC + ZBAC = 180° 50° + ZBAC + 70° = 180° 120° + ZBAC = 180°

We need to find ZA + ZB + ZC. We know that ZB = ZXAB, ZC = ZYAC. So, ZA + ZB+ZC = ZA+ ZXAB+ ZYAC = 180° as together they form a straight angle. Thus we have proved that the sum of the three angles in any triangle is 180°! This rather surprising result is called the angle sum property

of triangles. xX A Y IX

Fig. 7.7

Take some time to reflect upon how we figured out the angle sum property. In the beginning, the relationship between the third angle and the other two angles was not at all clear. However, a simple idea of drawing a line parallel to the base through the top vertex (as in Fig. 7.7) suddenly made the relationship obvious. This ingenious idea can be found in a very influential book in the history of mathematics called ‘The Elements’. This book is attributed to the Greek mathematician Euclid, who lived around 300 BCE.

This solution is yet another example of how creative thinking plays a key role in mathematics!

There is a convenient way of verifying the angle sum property by folding a triangular cut-out of a paper. Do you see how this shows that the sum of the angles in this triangle is 180°?

## Exterior Angles

The angle formed between the extension of a side of a triangle and the other side is called an exterior angle of the triangle. In this figure, ZACD is an exterior angle.


## Exterior Angle


## B Cc D

Find ZACD, if ZA = 50°, and 2B = 60°. From the angle sum property, we know that

50° + 60° + ZACB = 180°

110° + ZACB = 180°


## So, ZACB = 70°

So, ZACD = 180 °—70° = 110°,

since, ZACB and ZACD together form a straight angle. Find the exterior angle for different measures of 7A and ZB. Do you see any relation between the exterior angle and these two angles? [Hint: From angle sum property, we have 7A + 7B + ZACB = 180°.] We also have ZACD + ZACB = 180°, since they form a straight angle. What does this show?


## 7.4 Constructions Related to Altitudes of Triangles

There is another set of useful measurements with respect to a triangle — the height of each of its vertices with respect to the opposite sides.

In the world around us, we talk of the A heights of various objects: the height of a person, the height of a tree, the height of a building, etc. What do we mean by the word ‘height’?

Consider a triangle ABC. What is the height of the vertex A from its opposite 3 D Cc side BC, and how can it be measured? Fig. 7.8

Let AD be the line segment from A drawn perpendicular to BC. The length of AD is the height of the vertex A from BC. The line segment AD is said to be one of the ‘altitudes’ of the triangle. The other altitudes

## Construction of the Altitudes of a Triangle

Construct an arbitrary triangle. Label the vertices A, B, C taking BC to be the base.

(?) Construct the altitude from A to BC,

Constructing the altitude using just a ruler is not accurate. To get a more precise angle of 90°, we use a set square along with a ruler.

?) Can you see how to do this?

4/11/2025 7:31:57 PM


## A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines

Step 1: Keep the ruler aligned to the base. Place the set square on the ruler as shown, such that one of the edges of the right angle touches the ruler.

Step 2: Slide the set square along the ruler till the vertical edge of the set square touches the vertex A.

Step 3: Draw the altitude to BC through A using the vertical edge of the set square.

?) Does there exist a triangle in which a side is also an altitude?

Visualise such a triangle and draw a rough diagram.

We see that this happens in triangles where one of the angles is a right angle.

Triangles having one right angle are called right-angled triangles or simply right triangles.

## 7.5 Types of Triangles

In our study of triangles, we have encountered the following types of triangles; equilateral, isosceles, scalene and right-angled triangles.

?) Did you spot any other type of triangle?

The classification of triangles as equilateral and isosceles was based on equality of sides.

Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three different lengths.

## Equilateral Triangle Isosceles Triangle Scalene Triangle

Can a similar classification be done based on equality of angles? Is there any relation between these two classifications? We will answer these questions in a later chapter.

We used angle measures when classifying a triangle as a right- angled triangle.

?) What are the other types of triangles based on angle measures?

A classification of triangles based on their angle measures is acute- angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles. We have already seen what a right-angled triangle is. It is a triangle with one right angle. Similarly, an obtuse-angled triangle has one obtuse angle.

a, ?) What could an acute-angled triangle be? Can we define it as a Math triangle with one acute angle? Why not? Talk

In an acute-angled triangle, all three angles are acute angles.

ee SUMMARY }-------------------------

Use of a compass simplifies the construction of triangles when the sidelengths are given.

A set of three lengths where the length of each is smaller than the sum of the other two is said to satisfy the triangle inequality. Sidelengths of a triangle satisfy triangle inequality, and, if a given set of lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, a triangle can be constructed with those sidelengths.

Triangles can be constructed when the following measurements are given:

(a) two of the sides and their included angle


## (b) two angles and the included side

The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180°.

An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to its opposite side.

Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three different lengths.

Triangles are classified based on their angle measures as acute-angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles.

## Working with Fractions

Doing this by representing the fractions using a unit square is cumbersome. Let us find the product by observing what we did in the above cases.

In each case, the whole is divided into rows and columns.

The number of rows is the denominator of the multiplicand, which is 18 in this case.

The number of columns is the denominator @4 of the multiplier, which is 12 in this case.

Thus, the whole is divided into 18 x 12 equal |

## Is the Product Always Greater than the Numbers Multiplied?

Since, we know that when a number is multiplied by 1, the product remains unchanged, we will look at multiplying pairs of numbers where neither of them is 1.

When we multiply two counting numbers greater than 1, say 3 and 5, the product is greater than both the numbers being multiplied.

3x 5=15 The product, 15, is more than both 3 and 5. But what happens when we multiply + and 8?

In each of the division problems above, observe how we found the answer. Can we frame a rule that tells us how to divide two fractions? Let us consider the previous problem. 2.3 In every division problem we have 3 > 5 a dividend, divisor and quotient. The . _. . : Dividend Divisor technique we have been using to get the quotient is: 10 1. First, find the number which gives \ 1 when multiplied by the divisor. We see that the resulting number is a fraction whose numerator is the divisor’s denominator and denominator is the divisor’s numerator.

For the divisor 3 this fraction is 2. We call 3 the reciprocal of 3.

## A Dramma-tic Donation

The following problem is translated from Bhaskaracharya’s (Bhaskara II’s) book, Lildvati, written in 1150 CE.

“ 1 = — — — — — O wise one! A miser gave to a beggar 5 of 16 of 4 of 2 of 3 of m1 of a dramma. If you know the mathematics of fractions well, tell me O child, how many cowrie shells were given by the miser to the beggar.”

Dramma refers to a silver coin used in those times. The tale says that 1 dramma was equivalent to 1280 cowrie shells. Let’s see what fraction

of a dramma the person gave:

1,2.3,1,1 1)" 3% 3%a*5*i6%a part of a dramma.

4/12/2025 12:41:36 PM


## Chapter-8.indd 194


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Evaluating it gives —o_

7680° Upon simplifying to its lowest form, we get 6 __1_ 7680 1280°

So, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar.

You can see in the answer Bhaskaracharya’s humour! The miser had given the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie).

Around the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in different kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used were gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called drammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and cowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied depending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of coins and their purity.

Gold coins had high-value and were used in large transactions and to store wealth. Silver coins were more commonly used in everyday transactions. Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller transactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were used in very small transactions and as change.

If we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4 copper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells,

21 (4 1) 1 copper pana = 78 gold dinar 12*4 1 cowrie shell =___ copper panas

1 cowrie shell =____ gold dinar. A Pinch of History

As you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing a critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing and dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions as we use them today—equipped with the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in India. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Shulbastitra— which go back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction of fire altars for rituals—used general non-unit fractions extensively, including performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3.

Fractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of India as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to the reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of the revered Jain scholar Umasvati.

## Working with Fractions

General rules for performing arithmetic operations on fractions — in essentially the modern form in which we carry them out today — were first codified by Brahmagupta in his Brahmasphutasiddhanta in 628 CE. We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting general fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote:

“Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.” (Brahmasphutasiddhanta, Verse 12.1.3)


## axc x

That is,


## x


## 19a ala > a

For division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote:

“The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator and denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then multiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new) denominator.”

Bhaskara II in his book Lilavati in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s statement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal:

“Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Lilavati, Verse 2.3.40)

Both of these verses are equivalent to the formula:


## a.c_ad_axd bid b*c bxc’

Bhaskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Aryabhatiyabhashya on Aryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the geometric interpretation of multiplication of fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms of the division of a square into rectangles via equal divisions along the length and breadth.

Many other Indian mathematicians, such as Shridharacharya (c. 750 CE), Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), Caturveda Prithidakasvami (c. 860 CE), and Bhaskara II (c. 1150 CE) developed the usage of arithmetic
