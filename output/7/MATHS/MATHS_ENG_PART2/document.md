## FOREWORD

The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pafichakoshas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the stage for further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning from Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three- year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages.

For the Middle Stage, NCF-SE 2023 aims to equip students with the skills needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages— including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Science, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash the textbook of Mathematics for Grade 7, Part II; aligns with the expectations of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, in respect of creating a spark for initiating mathematical thinking. This textbook designed for Grade 7 students, takes forward its journey through the world of mathematics that started in Grade 6. While Part-I set the journey recapitulating Grade 6 Mathematics, Part-II takes an advanced path on mathematical concepts and prepares students for

Grade 8. During this journey the concepts and problems emerge from daily life situations and so it is expected that students will be able to relate to them with ease. This textbook makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore the patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas such as science, social science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). Colourful illustrations and interactive exercises form the basis of this textbook that would develop a strong foundation among children in understanding more complex mathematical concepts. Throughout the book, stories, conversations and anecdotes have been incorporated to make abstract mathematical concepts more relatable and accessible to young learners. Puzzles and innovative problems will not only engage the students in thoughtfully relating the mathematical concepts to the world around them and help them in deepening their understanding of mathematics, but also prepare them to understand the concepts of the emerging field of computational thinking. The focus is on collaboration and active engagement through student-centered approach to education.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

## ABOUT THE BOOK

Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics can also contribute to the development of capacities for making informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus has an important role to play in achieving the overall aims of school education.

Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and has to perform the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of the child and being abstract. It must perform the dual role of developing intuition while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It must perform the dual role of enhancing critical and logical thinking while also developing artistry and creativity and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Finally, Mathematics must perform the dual role of providing students plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovery of concepts on their own while also teaching best-known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics.

The present textbook has made an attempt to address the above mentioned goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers of this book have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods to develop in students both intuition and rigour. The book also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student-teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the book to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open-ended to stimulate in-class discussion.

Chapter 1 of this textbook, ‘Geometric Twins’, introduces the concept of congruence of plane figures. Chapter 2, ‘Integers — Multiplication and Division’ is about how to multiply and divide positive and negative integers. Chapter 3, ‘Finding Common Ground’, deals with the ideas of common factors, common multiples, prime factorisation, HCF and LCM. Chapter 4, ‘Decimals — Multiplication and Division’ is about learning how to handle decimal numbers in practical and systematic way. It builds on earlier knowledge of decimals and extends it to

operations. Chapter 5, ‘Connecting the Dots’, introduces the concept of central tendency (mean, median and mode). Chapter 6, ‘Constructions and Tilings’, introduces children to practical geometry and patterns in shapes. Chapter 7, ‘Finding the Unknown’, is about algebra and simple equations. It introduces children to the idea that we can use letters (like x, y) and then find their value using rules of arithmetic. In all chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasis connections with other subjects including Art, History, and Science.

By weaving storytelling and hands-on activities together, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give children the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other, provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage children to find many different ways to solve problems.

As per the NEP 2020, computational thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage such thinking. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics.

The concepts and problems are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials with which the students are familiar. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used. At many places, exercises or activities are given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. This textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom.

We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers will use this as an opportunity to revise these concepts in a spiralling way so that children are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may give more time to the ideas of congruence of triangles, concept of central tendencies and other notions that are new to students. Many of these are the basis for further learning in mathematics.

Finally, this textbook aims to be more than just a texthook—it’s a passportto a world ofmathematical discovery and exploration. Whether used in the classroom or at home, we hope that it may inspire students to embark on their own mathematical adventures, empowering them to see the beauty and relevance of mathematics in everything around them. With its engaging approach and comprehensive coverage of Grade 7 mathematics concepts, this textbook hopes and aims to captivate young minds and set them on a lifelong journey of mathematical discovery.

I thank again all the writers and contributors of this textbook for their important and valuable contribution and service to the nation’s mathematics teachers, learners and enthusiasts.

We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding the book and hope that you will send interesting exercises, activities and tasks that you develop during the course of teaching and learning, to be included in future editions.

## NOTE TO THE TEACHER

We hope that this textbook, Ganita Prakash, will serve as a strong support and guide to you in achieving the exciting task that you have before you — that of passing on the joy of learning the beautiful subject of Mathematics to the next generation.

This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering ofmathematicalthinkingin the minds ofstudents. Classrooms, where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions.

Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups.

Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.

While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics.

It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students.

To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this book are marked using the icon (?). This icon is an indicator of a potential opportunity to start off a process of problem solving and exploration in the classroom. You will find some of the problems

labelled ‘Math Talk’. Such questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion.

An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problem-solving approaches. These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations.

To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to ‘cover’ all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them.

It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills, they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration.

Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting word problems.

This textbook contains a number of open-ended problems. It also contains new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to solve them or follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay! Not everyone knows everything. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, it will be very useful to take it to the classroom and open it up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. This process itself can throw a lot of light on the content.

In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them.

It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful time using this textbook!


## Summary of Key Points


## Time for Exploration

1. Itis important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns, or challenges to the students and give them sufficient time to play with, discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups.

2. During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.

3. There should be a culture where students pose problems to each other and discuss with each other various ways to approach the problems.


## About the Problems in the Book

1. The exploratory problems in the textbook not only promote problem solving; they also aim to strengthen procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration.

2. Trying to ‘cover’ all the problems in the book must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with, discussing, and solving them.


## Reading

1. Encourage students to read the book by themselves and in groups.

2. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and to express it to others.


## Right of Not Knowing!

1. It is perfectly okay if some of the content is not understood immediately. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, it can also be taken to the classroom and opened up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them!

2. Learning is a continual process. Indeed, there is so much in mathematics that is still not known and requires further exploration!

A NOTE TO STUDENTS!

To be able to appreciate the art of mathematics, it is not enough to just be a passive spectator. You need to immerse yourself in its process like a detective getting into action to solve a mystery.

This is especially required when you see a new question or when a question arises from your own sense of wonder, or when you come across a new beautiful pattern. When you encounter these, pause your reading, and use your creativity to work out the question or understand and appreciate the pattern.

You will find that some questions are accompanied by their answers. Even if this is the case, it is worthwhile to work on the problems by yourself or in a group before you see the answer.

This will enrich your experience of going through the book!

Whenever there are questions coming up, you will see this icon: (?)- This indicates that it is time for figuring things out!

Sometimes you will find many questions collected together in a single place under the title ‘Figure it Out’. C)

Mae Some questions are marked . These questions are meant to

be discussed and worked out with your friends.

Finally, there are questions marked Cra These questions

demand more creativity to be answered, and therefore will also often be more fun to answer as a result!

One way is to trace the outline of this symbol on tracing paper to reconstruct the figure. But this is difficult for big symbols. What else can we do?

?) Can we take some measurements that would allow us to exactly recreate this figure? If yes, what measurements should we take?

Let us name the corner points of this symbol as shown.


## A Cc


## B

?) Are the arm lengths AB and BC sufficient to exactly recreate this figure?

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

Suppose these lengths are AB = 4 cm, BC = 8 cm. We observe that several such symbols can be constructed with the same lengths.

c c A \~ \ ‘ \ \ B B B B ?) To get the exact replica, would it help to take any other measurement?

The measure of ZABC, along with the two arm lengths AB and BC, fix the shape and size of this figure.

?) Can you draw the symbol if it is known that AB = 4 cm, BC = 8 cm, and ZABC = 80°?

These three measurements can help us create an exact replica of the symbol on the signboard. Figures that are exact copies of each other or have the same shape and size are said to be congruent. Congruent figures can be superimposed exactly, one over the other.

Two congruent figures are shown below. You could use a tracing paper to trace the first figure and superimpose it on the second one. You will find that they fit exactly, one over the other.


## GG

Note that while checking for congruence, a figure can be rotated or flipped before superimposing it on the other figure. So, the following pairs of figures are also congruent to each other.

Let us get back to the symbol we saw on the signboard. Suppose there are two such symbols that look identical and we need to confirm that they are indeed congruent. Can we use their measurements to verify this?

?) If it is known that both symbols have the same arm lengths, can it be concluded that the two symbols are congruent?

We have seen that there can exist several such non-congruent figures with different angles between the given arm lengths. Fixing the angle determines the shape and size of the figure.

Thus, if both symbols have the same arm lengths and angle, we can be sure that the figures are congruent.

## Measuring the Sidelengths

Can certain measurements of the triangle be used for this? Using a measuring tape, the girls measure the sides of the triangle to be 40 cm, 60 cm, and 80 cm.

Then, Rabia takes out her protractor to measure the angles. She is stopped by Meera.

Meera: The angles of the triangle are not required! With the side lengths we have measured, we can create a triangle congruent to this one.

?) Do you agree with Meera?

?) Instead of the lengths being 40 cm, 60 cm, and 80 cm, suppose the

sidelengths had been 4 cm, 6 cm, 8 cm (this triangle can fit on our page).

?) Is this information sufficient to replicate the triangle with the same size

and shape? If yes, can you do so?

Rabia: If I were to construct this triangle, I would first draw a line segment having one of the given lengths, say 6 cm, and then draw circles from each of its end points with radii 4 cm and 8 cm. But the circles would intersect at two points, forming two triangles:

Rabia: Do these two triangles have the same shape and size? If not, then we will not be sure which of these would actually be congruent to

the original triangle we are trying to replicate.

(©) Examine whether AABE and AABF are congruent.

For this, you could use one or more of the following methods — tracing and comparing, taking a cutout and superimposing, or observing that AB acts as a line of symmetry due to the ‘sameness’ of the act of construction above and below this line.

We see that AABE and AABF are congruent. From this general construction, we can see that all triangles with the same sidelengths are congruent. Hence, Meera was right when she said that the sidelengths are sufficient to construct a congruent triangle.

Thus, we have the following result:

If two triangles have the same sidelengths, then they are congruent.

We call this the SSS (Side Side Side) condition for congruence.


## Conventions to Express Congruence

The twotriangles given below are congruent. How can these two triangles be superimposed? Which vertices of AXYZ and AABC should we overlap?

?) This has to be done so that the equal sides overlap. Figure out how.

## A BY

Overlapping Vertex A over Vertex X, Vertex B over Vertex Y and Vertex C over Vertex Z will ensure that equal sides overlap, making the triangles fit exactly over each other.

Are there other ways of overlapping the vertices so that the triangles fit exactly over each other?

The fact that these triangles are congruent shows that their respective angles are equal: A= ZX, ZB= ZY and ZC = ZZ

Thus, when two triangles are congruent, there are corresponding vertices, sides and angles which fit exactly over each other when the triangles are made to overlap. In this case, they are

We see that this correspondence lays the side AB of AABD over the side CB of ACDB. But these sides need not be equal, and hence, this superimposition will not establish congruence.

These triangles are seen to have the same shape, but not the same size. Hence, two triangles that have the same set of angles need not be congruent.

Measuring Two Sides and the Included Angle ?) AABC and AXYZ are two triangles such that

AB = XY = 6 cm, AC = XZ =5 cm, and ZA = ZX = 30°

Are they congruent?

To check this, we need to see if there can exist non-congruent triangles with the given measurements.

These measurements correspond to the case of two sides and the included angle. We have seen how to construct a triangle given these measurements.

?) Construct a triangle having the above measurements.

Hence, we can draw two non-congruent triangles with the given measurements.

This is called the SSA (Side Side Angle) condition. We have seen that SSA condition does not guarantee congruence.

We have examined cases using two sides and an angle for determining congruence. Can we use two angles and a side? Let us first take the case of two angles and the included side.

Two Angles and the Included Side ?) AABC and AXYZ are two triangles with,

BC = YZ=5cm, ZB= ZY = 50° and ZC = ZZ = 30°. Are they congruent?

(?) Can there exist non-congruent triangles having these measurements? Construct and find out.

We have seen how to construct a triangle when we are given two angles and the included side.

This construction should make it clear that all the triangles having these measurements must be congruent to each other. Hence, AABC = AXYZ.

This condition is referred to as the ASA (Angle Side Angle) condition for congruence.

(?) In the figure, Point O is the midpoint of AD and BC. What can one say about the lengths AB and CD?

We have, AO = OD (as O is the midpoint of AD)

BO = OC (as O is the midpoint of BC).

(©) Are there any other equal sides or angles? We also have,

ZAOB = ZDOC, as they are vertically opposite angles.

We see that the SAS condition (two sides and the included angle) is satisfied, and so we can conclude that the triangles are congruent.


## What are the Corresponding Vertices?

As we need AO and OD to overlap, and BO and CO to overlap for the triangles to exactly fit over each other, the corresponding vertices in AAOB and ADOC are A and D, O and O (vertex common to both the triangles), and B and C. Thus,

AAOB = ADOC. AB and DC are corresponding sides as they overlap when the triangles are superimposed. Thus, their lengths are equal.

or ZB + 110° = 180°


## Thus, ZB = 70°.

Similarly, ZY is also 70°.

Thus, we have 4B = ZY.

In Fig. 1.2, the equalities are between two angles and the non-included side of the two triangles. This condition is referred to as the AAS (Angle Angle Side) condition.

As we have seen, the AAS condition guarantees congruence.

We have seen that the SSA condition doesn’t always guarantee congruence. However, there are some special cases when SSA does guarantee congruence. Here is one such important case.

(©) Consider the downward extension of line | below QR. Would the arc

from R meet this line downwards as well (as in the case of triangle construction when the sidelengths are given)? If so, would this lead to a triangle whose size and shape are different from APQR, and yet has the given measurements?

It can be seen that the other triangle we get below is also congruent to APQR. Why? Therefore, all triangles having these measurements will be congruent to each other.

Thus, we conclude that AABC = AXYZ.

In the case that we have considered, the parts that are equal to their corresponding parts in another triangle are

(a) the right angle (b) two other sides, one of which is opposite to the right angle. This side is called the hypotenuse.

This is called the RHS (Right Hypotenuse Side) condition, and is one more condition for congruence. Conditions that are sufficient to guarantee congruence

From the discussions so far, we can see that two triangles are congruent if any of the following conditions are satisfied:


## (a) SSS condition (b) SAS condition


## (c) ASA condition (d) AAS condition


## (e) RHS condition


## 1.3 Angles of Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles

## B Cc D

Thus, the triangles satisfy the RHS condition. Hence, AADB ~ AADC.

This shows that ZB = /C, as they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles.

Thus, the angles opposite to equal sides are equal.

?) Can you use this fact to find 2B and ZC?

sides are equal. A

Similarly, the sides AB and BC are equal. So ZA = ZC. So, all the three angles of an equilateral triangle are equal, just like their sides.

(©) What could be their measures?

As the three angles should add up to 180°, we have 3 x angle in an equilateral triangle = 180°. So each angle is 60°.

(?) Verify this by construction.

Thus, just using the notion of congruence, we have deduced that the angles of an equilateral triangle are all 60°.

Figures that have the same shape and size are said to be congruent. These figures can be superimposed so that one fits exactly over the other. While verifying congruence, a figure can be rotated or flipped to make it fit exactly over the other figure via superimposition.

When two triangles have the same sidelengths, we say that the SSS (Side Side Side) condition is satisfied. The SSS condition guarantees congruence.

When two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included angle of another triangle, we say that the SAS (Side Angle Side) condition is satisfied. The SAS condition also guarantees congruence.

When two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to the two angles and the included angle of another triangle, we say that the ASA (Angle Side Angle) condition is satisfied. The ASA condition guarantees congruence. Congruence holds even if the side is not included between the angles AAS (Angle Angle Side) condition.

In a right-angled triangle, the side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse.

When a side and a hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle are equal to a side and the hypotenuse of another right-angled triangle, we say that the RHS (Right Hypotenuse Side) condition is satisfied. The RHS condition also guarantees congruence.

Two triangles need not be congruent if two sides and a non-included angle are equal.

In a triangle, angles opposite to equal sides are equal.

The coin is at 0. If it is struck twice (the direction of the two strikes may be the same or different) can you give a formula for the final position of the coin?

One way to do this is to consider different cases of the directions of the strikes

¢ both are rightward,

¢ both are leftward,

the first one is rightward and the second one is leftward, and ¢ the first one is leftward and the second one is rightward.

An efficient way to model this situation is to use positive and negative integers. First, let us model the line on which the coin moves as a number line.

Let us consider the rightward movement positive and the leftward movement negative. Suppose the first strike moves the coin rightward by 5 units from 0, and the second strike leftward by 7 units, then we take the First Movement = 5 units. Second Movement = —7 units.

?) What is the final position of the coin? This can be found by simply adding the two movements: 5 + (—7) = -2.

So the coin is at —2, or it is 2 units to the left of 0.

In general, if the first strike moves the coin ‘a’ units (which is positive if the strike is to the right and negative if the strike is to the left), and the second strike ‘b’ units (which is positive if the strike is to the right and negative if the strike is to the left), then the final position ‘P’, after the two strikes, is again P=a+b.

(?) Based on this new model, answer the following questions:

In addition to the number line, we used the token model to understand integers. We used this model to perform addition and subtraction in Grade 6. Let us do a quick recall. We used green (@) token to represent positive 1 and red (@) token to represent negative 1, that is -1. Together they make zero, as they cancel each other out.

(2) Find (+7) - (+18).

To subtract 18 from 7, i.e., (+7) — (+18), we need to remove 18 positives

But there are not enough tokens to remove 18 positives! We put in enough zero pairs so that we can remove 18 positives.

We can now remove 18 positives.

What is left? There are 11 negatives, meaning -11. So, 7-18 =-11.

## 2.2 Multiplication of Integers

We used the token model to represent addition and subtraction of integers. We now explore how to model multiplication of integers using tokens.

like 4 x (-2)? Let us see how.

For every new operation, we start © © © © with an empty bag.

4 x (-2) can be interpreted as placing © © © ©


## 2 negatives into an empty bag 4 times.

We use red tokens for negatives, so we

place 2 negatives into an empty bag 4 Two red tokens 4 times =—8 times. 4x (-2)=-8

There are now 8 red tokens or : 8 negatives in the bag, meaning —8. __ 4x (2) = (8). Multiplicand

?) Similarly find the values of 4 x (—6) and 9 x (-7)? How can we interpret (4) x 2? When the multiplier is positive, we place tokens into the bag. When the multiplier is negative, we remove tokens from the bag. So, for (4) x 2, we need to remove two positives or two green tokens from the bag 4 times.

Math vl ?) Why are we trying to remove green tokens and not red tokens?

But there are no tokens in the bag, because we start with an empty bag. Just as in the case of subtraction, to remove 2 positives from an empty bag, we need to first place 2 zero pairs inside and then remove the 2 positives. We need to do this 4 times.


## GO GO GCOS GO GO GO GO SO

Remove 2 green tokens from the zero pairs, 4 times (-4)x2=-8

After removing the positives, 8 negatives are left in the bag. This is —8. This shows that (4) x 2 =-8.

?) What happens when both the integers in the multiplication are negative? How do we model (-4) x (-2) with tokens?

For (—4) x (-2), we need to remove 2 negatives from the bag 4 times. Since there are no red tokens in the bag, we need to place 2 zero pairs and remove 2 negatives, and we need to do this 4 times.

OS @8 @S OS @2S @8 ©8 0S

Remove 2 red tokens from the zero pairs, 4 times (- 4) x(-2)=8 8 positives are left in the bag. This is + 8. So, -4x-2=+8. So far, we have established the following results by using tokens: 4x2 =8, 4x (-2) =-8, (-4) x 2=-8, and (-4) x C2) = 8.

## Patterns in Integer Multiplication

(- 4) x2

We have explored the multiplication of integers in cases where the multiplier is positive, when it is negative, when the multiplicand is positive and when it is negative. Using this understanding, let us construct a sequence of multiplications and observe the patterns.

What do you notice in this pattern? Can you describe it?

We can see that, when the multiplicand is positive, for every unit decrease in the multiplier the product decreases by the multiplicand.

?) Will this pattern continue when the multiplier goes below zero and becomes a negative number? Yes indeed! The same pattern continues when the multiplier becomes a negative number.

?) What is the pattern when the multiplicand is a negative integer? 4 x (-3) =-12 >+ 3

Even when the multiplier is negative, the same pattern is observed. When the multiplicand is negative, for every unit decrease in the multiplier, the product increases by the multiplicand.

We can see from these patterns that, what is true for multiplication when the integers are positive, is also true when the integers are negative.

=1 =1 3 = 18 3=21 3 = 24 3 = 27 3 = 30

We observe the following:

¢ The magnitude of the product does not change with the change in the signs of the multiplier and the multiplicand.

¢ When both the multiplier and the multiplicand are positive, the

product is positive.

¢ When both the multiplier and the multiplicand are negative, the

product is positive.

¢ When one of the multiplier or the multiplicand is positive and the other is negative, their product is negative.

(c) (-5)x CD (d) (-8)x4 (e) (-9)x 10 (f) 10 x (-17) Consider the expression 1 x a. We know that the value of this expression is ‘a’ for all positive integers. ?) Is this true for all negative integers too? Using the token model, we put ‘a’ negatives into the bag just once. After

this, the bag contains ‘a’ negatives. For example, if ‘a’ is—5 (5 negatives), then the bag contains 5 negatives, i.e., -5. So,


## 1x a=a (for all integers a, both positive and negative).

What is the value of the expression —1 = a?

When ‘a’ is positive, then from our observations on integer multiplication, the product has the same magnitude as ‘a’ but is negative. When ‘a’ is negative, then the product has the same magnitude as ‘a’ but is positive. In each case, we notice that the product is the additive inverse of the multiplicand ‘a’. Thus, -1xa=-a (for all integers a).

?) In the case of integers, is the product the same when we swap the multiplier and the multiplicand? Try this for some numbers.

Observe the following pairs of multiplications (fill in the blanks where needed):

3x-4=-12 -4x3=-12 -30x12=_ 12x-30=

15 x-8 = 120 -—8 x -15 = 120

?) What do you notice in these pairs of multiplication statements?

The product is the same when we ‘swap’ the multiplier and multiplicand. Earlier, we have seen a similar property with addition.

?) Will this always happen?

The magnitude of the product does not change when the multiplier and the multiplicand are swapped. This is because the magnitude of the product depends only on the magnitudes of the multiplier and the multiplicand, and we know that the product of two positive integers does not change when the numbers being multiplied are swapped.

## Operations with Integers

Does the sign of the product change if we swap the multiplier and multiplicand?

If both are positive or both are negative, the product is positive before and after swapping. So the sign does not change in this case. If one is positive and the other negative, the product is negative before and after swapping. So the sign does not change in this case either. Hence, the product does not change when the multiplier and multiplicand are swapped, whatever their signs may be. Thus, multiplication is commutative for integers. In general, for any two integers, a and b, we can say that axb=bxa. Brahmagupta’s Rules for Multiplication and Division of Positive and Negative Numbers Just like for addition and subtraction of integers, Brahmagupta in his Brahmasphutasiddhanta (628 CE) also articulated explicit rules for integer multiplication and division. He used the notions of fortune (dhana) for positive values and debt (rna) for negative values. In his Brahmasphutasiddhanta (18.30-32), Brahmagupta wrote: “The product or quotient of two fortunes is a fortune. The product or quotient of two debts is a fortune. The product or quotient of a debt and a fortune is a debt. The product or quotient of a fortune and a debt is a debt.” This represented the first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated, and was an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra!

?) Example 1: An exam has 50 multiple choice questions. 5 marks are given

for every correct answer and 2 negative marks for every wrong answer. What are Mala’s total marks if she had 30 correct answers and 20 wrong answers? Solution: We use positive and negative integers. The mark for each correct answer is a positive integer 5 and for each wrong answer is a negative integer —2. Marks for 30 correct answers = 30 x 5. Marks for 20 wrong answers = 20 x (—2).

Thus the arithmetic expression for 30 correct answers and 20 wrong answers is:

30 x 5 + 20 x (-2) = 150 + (40) = 110.

Mala got 110 marks in the exam.

?) Example 2: There is an elevator in a mining shaft that moves above

and below the ground. The elevator’s positions above the ground are represented as positive integers and positions below the ground are represented as negative integers.

(a) The elevator moves 3 metres per minute. If it descends into the shaft from the ground level (0), what will be its position after one hour?

(b) If it begins to descend from 15 m above the ground, what will be its position after 45 minutes?


## Solution:


## Solution to part (a) of the question:

Method 1: We can model this using subtraction.

The elevator moves at 3 metres per minute. So in one hour it moves 180 metres (60 « 3). If it started at ground level (0 metres) and descended, we should subtract 180 from 0.

0-180 = (-180). So, it will reach the (-180) metre position, which is 180 metres below the ground.

Method 2: Let us say that the speed and direction of the elevator are represented by an integer (metres per minute). It is +3 when it is moving up and it is (-3) when moving down.

Since the elevator is moving down, the speed is (—3) metres per minute. It moves for 60 minutes. So it goes

60 x (—3) = (-180).

## Division of Integers

We have earlier seen how division can be converted into multiplication. For example, (— 100) + 25 can be reframed as, ‘what should be multiplied to 25 to get (-100)?’. That is, 25 x ?=(-100). We know that 25 x (-4) = (-100). Therefore, (-100) = 25 = (4).

Similarly, (- 100) + (-4) can be reframed as, ‘What should be multiplied to (—4) to get (- 100)?” (-4) x ? = (100).

We know that

(—4) x 25 = (-100). Therefore,

(-100) = (-4) = 25. Similarly, we know that

(-25) x (2) = 50. Therefore,

50 + (-25) =(-2).

Players take turns. Ineach turn, they can move a single coin along a line, in any direction, to a neighbouring vacant intersection. Or, if an opponent’s coin is at a neighbouring intersection, and there is a vacant intersection just beyond it, they can jump over the opponent’s coin and land in the vacant intersection.

¢ Ifaplayer jumps over an opponent’s coin, it is considered captured and is removed from the board. Multiple captures in one move are allowed, and the direction can change after each jump.

e Inside the triangular corners, which are outside the main square, a coin may skip an intersection and move straight to the next one. That is, it can jump over an empty intersection and go to the one beyond it.

(?) Sameeksha is building her new house. The main room of the house is 12 ft by 16 ft. She feels that the room would look nice if the floor is covered with square tiles of the same size. She also wants to use as few tiles as possible, and for the length of the tile to be a whole number of feet. What size tiles should she buy?

Let us explore how to find the largest square tile that can be used. The breadth of the room is 12 ft and the length is 16 ft.

For the tiles to fit the breadth of the room exactly, the side of the tile should be a factor of 12. Similarly, for the tiles to fit the length of the room exactly, the side should be a factor of 16. So the side of the tile should be a factor of both 12 and 16. What are the common factors of 12 and 16?

The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

The common factors are 1, 2, and 4.

Factors of 108 — 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, and 108.

Since, Lekhana wants to use bags of the same weight for both farms, the weight of the bag should be a common factor. The common factors of 84 and 108 are

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. She can use any of these weights to pack rice from both farms in bags

of equal weight. But, she wants to minimise the number of bags. Which weight should she choose to minimise the number of bags?

## Finding Common Ground

So far, we have been listing all the factors to find the HCF. This can become cumbersome for numbers with many factors, as you would have observed for the numbers 30 and 50, and 28 and 42.

Sometimes, we may also miss some factors which can lead to errors.

?) Can this process be simplified? Can it be made more reliable?

It turns out that using prime factorisation can simplify the process. We will start by revisiting primes and prime factorisation.


## Primes

Recall that a prime is a number greater than 1 that has only 1 and the number itself as its factors. Last year, we tried to find patterns amongst primes between 1 to 100. We also came across the Sieve of Eratosthenes — a method to list all primes.


## Prime Factorisation

Any number can be written as a product of primes— keep rewriting composite factors until only primes are left.

Recall that we call this the prime factorisation of a given number. For example, we can find the prime factorisation of 90 as follows:

90=3x3%x2x5.

The number 90 could also have been factorised as 3 x 30 or 2 x 45 or in a few other different ways. Will these all lead to the same prime factors?

Remarkably, the resulting prime factors are always the same with perhaps only a change in their order. For example, if we consider factorising 3 x 30 further, we get

90=3x 30=3*2x15=3x2x3x5, and we have arrived at the same prime factors, just in a different order.

Note that the prime factorisation of a prime number is the prime number itself.

Procedure for Prime Factorisation Can you see what is happening below?

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

Each circled number is the product of the numbers that are to its left and below. For example, 30 = 2 x 15, 15 = 3 x 5. Each time, a composite number is factorised so that, at least one factor is prime. We stop when we reach a prime number.

Can you write the prime factorisation of 105 and 30 using these two figures?

We collect the prime factors along the left and the one (108)

at the bottom. We then construct the prime factorisation as shown in the figure. While carrying out factorisation, the circles are usually

left out and the steps are carried out in this format: (35)

3} 105 2| 30 5| 35 3} 15

7 5

105=3x5*x7

Let us call this method the division method.

Try finding the prime factorisation of 1200 using the method above. If we had used the earlier method, our calculation would have been as follows:

1200 = 40 x 30=5x8x5*x6=...

Which calculation is easier to carry out?


## Factors of a Number Using Prime Factorisation

From the prime factorisation of a number, we can construct all its factors. This can be used to simplify the procedure for finding the HCF of two numbers.

Consider the number 840 and its prime factorisation 2 x 2x 2*x3x5x7.

(©) Is 2x 2 7=28 a factor of 840?

?) If yes, what should it be multiplied by to get 840?

To answer these questions, we can reorder the prime factors of 840 as follows (recall that reordering factors does not change the product):

840 = (2x 2x 7) x (2x35).

So, 840 = 28 x 30.

Thus, (2 x 2 x 7) = 28 is a factor of 840, and it should be multiplied by 30 (2 x 3 x 5) to get 840.

Is 3 x 3 x 3.a factor of 840? Why or why not?

Can we use this idea to list down all the possible factors of a number using just its prime factors?

?) Find the factors of 225 using prime factorisation. 5 | 225 5 | 45 Factorising 225 to its primes, we get 3] 9 225=5x5x3 x3. 313

We have seen that any ‘subpart’ of this factorisation gives us a factor. Let us systematically form these subparts. Prime factors: 3, 5. Combination of two prime factors: 3 x 3=9,5«5=25,3x5=15. Combination of three prime factors: 3 x 3x 5=45,3x5x5=75. Combination of four prime factors: 3 x 3 x 5 x 5 = 225. Adding 1 to this list of factors, we see that the factors of 225 are 1, 3,5, 9, 15, 25, 45, 75, 225.

?) Check that all the factors of 225 occur in this list.

After observing a few prime factorisations, Anshu claims “The larger a number is, the longer its prime factorisation will be”. What do you think of Anshu’s claim?

We can see that it is not true. For example, look at the prime factorisations of 96 and 121.

96=2x2x2x2x2x3

7 In mathematics, statements or claims made without proof or verification conjecture is false.

Finding the HCF of Numbers Using Prime Factorisation We now see how to make use of the observations made so far to find common factors and the Highest Common Factor (HCF). ?) Example 1: Find the common factors, and the HCF of 45 and 75. Calculate the prime factorisation for both numbers: 45=3%x3x5 75=3x5x5, We have seen: Factors of 45 are subparts of factors occurring in 3 x 3 x 5 and factors of 75 are subparts of factors occurring in 3 x 5 x 5.

So the common factors should be subparts of both the factorisations. Can you write them down?

While exploring or solving problems you might also get some conjectures. You can try to reason and verify these and also share with the class.

There is no subpart that is common amongst these two factorisations. So, 1 is the only common factor. It is also their HCF.

How do we directly find the HCF without listing all the factors? ?) Example 4: Find the HCF of 30 and 72.

30=2x3%x5 72=2x2x2x3x3

We need the largest common subpart to find the HCF. Clearly, it will contain only those primes that occur in both the factorisations: 2 and 3


## in this case.

How many 2s will it contain?

10/9/2025 11:49:06 AM


## Chapter-3.indd 54


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

The prime factorisation of 30 has only one 2. So, the largest common subpart should contain only one 2.

How many 3s will it contain?

The prime factorisation of 30 has only one 3. So, the largest common subpart should contain only one 3.

This has been carried out below.

30 =|2|x|3|x 5S 72 =|2|x 2x 2 x|3)x 3

HCF=2x3=6

Thus, to find the HCF, we identify the common primes and find the minimum number of times each of them appear in the factorisations of the given numbers.

(?) Example 5: Find the HCF of 225 and 750.

225 =3x3x5x5 750=2x3x5x5x5 Common primes: 3 and 5. Let us find the largest common subpart. How many 3s will it contain?

750 contains only one 3, which is the minimum number of 3 across both numbers. So the largest common subpart should contain only one 3.

How many 5s will it contain? 225 = 3 x/3\x/5|x/5 225 contains the minimum number of 5s

which occurs two times. So, the largest common 750 = 2 |3)x|5]x|5|x 5

subpart should contain two 5s, ie., 5 x 5. HCE =3x5x5=75

To find the HCF of more than 2 numbers, a similar method of finding the largest common subpart of the common primes can be followed.

2. Consider the numbers 72 and 144. Suppose they are factorised into composite numbers as: 72 = 6 x 12 and 144 = 8 x 18. Seeing this, can one say that these two numbers have no common factor other than 1? Why not?

## 3.2 Least, but not Last!

Anshu and Guna make torans out of strips of cloth. Multiple strips are placed one next to another to make a toran. Anshu uses strips of length 6 cm and Guna uses strips of 8 cm length. If both have to make torans of the same length, what is the smallest possible length, the torans could be?

What is the length of the shortest toran that they can both make?

Anshu uses cloth strips of 6 cm each. Any toran he makes will be a multiple of 6. So, the length of the toran could be 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 cm, and so on.

Similarly, any toran Guna makes should bea multiple of 8. So, the length of the toran he makes could be 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72 cm, and so on.

From this, we can see that if both have to make torans of the same length, the length of the toran should be a common multiple of 6 and 8.

From the two lists, we can see that 24 and 48 are two of the common multiples of 6 and 8. So, 24 cm and 48 cm are lengths of toran that Anshu and Guna can both stitch.

24 is the smallest among them. So, 24 cm is the length of the shortest toran that both can stitch. 24 is the lowest number among all the common multiples of 6 and 8.

What about the largest common multiple? Does such a number exist?

Gajak is a sweet made from sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee

As we saw before, imagining or visualising the scenario helped us to see that it can be solved using multiples of the strips’ lengths.

Since the shop gives free sweets every Monday, it will give free sweets again after 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, ... days.

These are multiples of 7.

Kabamai will arrive at the sweet shop again after 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, ... days.

These are multiples of 10.

When will Kabamai eat free sweets again? It will happen on days common to the sequences of multiples above. It can be seen that this will first happen after 70 days.

Notice that, here too, 70 is the lowest among all the common multiples of 7 and 10.

For both these problems the solution was the lowest common multiple. The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more given numbers is the lowest (or smallest or least) of their common multiples.

(?) Do you remember the ‘Idli-Vada’ game from Grade 6 (see chapter

‘Prime Time’)? Two numbers are chosen and whenever players come to their multiples, ‘idli’ or ‘vada’ should be called out depending on whose multiple the number is. If the number happens to be a common multiple, then ‘idli-vada’ should be called out. In each problem below, the two numbers corresponding to ‘idl’ and ‘vada’ are given. Find the first number for which ‘idli-vada’ will be called out:

(a) 4and6 (b) 7and 11 (c) 14and 30 (d) 15 and 55

Is the answer always the LCM of the two numbers? Explain.

As in the case of the HCF, the process of finding the LCM by listing down the multiples may get tedious for larger numbers, as you would have seen for questions (c) and (d) above.

Prime factorisation can simplify the process of finding the LCM as well.

?) How do we find the LCM of two numbers using their prime factors?


## Finding LCM through Prime Factorisation

We have seen that every factor of anumber is formed by taking a subpart of its prime factorisation. We used this fact to come up with a method to find the HCF of two numbers. In a similar manner, we can come up with a method to find the LCM.

We begin by comparing the prime factorisations of a number and a multiple of that number. For example, let us take 36 and its multiple 648 (=36 x 18).

## Finding Common Ground

We get, 36=2*2x 3x3, 648 = 36 x 18 =(2x 2x 3x 3)x(2x 3x 3).

What do you observe? We can see that the prime factors of the multiple contain the prime factors of the number along with some more prime factors. Will this happen with every multiple?

Can this be used to find the LCM?

?) Example 6: Find the LCM of 14 and 35. We get, 14=2%x7 35=5% 7.

Common multiples should contain each prime factor as a subpart: 2x 7 asa subpart and 5 x 7 as a subpart. For example,


## 2x7x5*x7x3isacommon multiple of 14 and 35.

2x 2x5 x 7x 7x11 is another common multiple.

?) Is 2x 3x5 x7 also a common multiple?

?) What is the lowest among all the common multiples of 14 and 35?

It is 2 x 5 x 7 = 70 because 2 x 5 x 7 contains 14 = 2 x 7 as well as 35 = 5 x 7, and removing any number from 2 x 5 x 7 will give a number that is not a common multiple of 14 and 35.

?) Example 7: Find the LCM of 96 and 360.

We have, 96=2x2x2x2x2x3 360=2x2x2x3x3x5.

Every common multiple should contain the prime factors of both 96 and 360. For the LCM, we will need the smallest such number. Let us build the LCM looking at each prime factor.

The prime factors appearing in both the numbers are 2, 3 and 5.

Now, we shall find out how many occurrences there are for each prime factor.


## (?) How many 2s should the LCM contain?

The factorisation of 96 contains 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (five occurrences of 2s) and the factorisation of 360 contains 2 x 2 x 2 (three occurrences of 2s). Choosing five occurrences of 2s as part of LCM will contain both these subparts.


## ‘ey J

10/9/2025 11:49:07 AM


## Chapter-3.indd 58


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

Choosing more than five occurrences of 2s will give a common multiple; but it will not be the lowest. Are you able to see why?


## ?) How many 3s should the LCM contain?

The factorisation of 96 contains 3 (one occurrence of 3) and the factorisation of 360 contains 3 x 3 (two occurrences of 3s). Choosing two occurrences of 3s as part of LCM will contain both these subparts.


## ?) How many 5s should the LCM contain?

The factorisation of 96 doesn’t have any 5s and the factorisation of 360 has one occurrence of 5. So, we choose one occurrence of 5 to bea part of the LCM.

Thus, the LCM of 96 and 360 will be2x2x2x2x2x3x3x5=1440.

To build the LCM of two numbers, we can identify all the prime factors and find the maximum number of times each of them occur in either of the factorisations. This process can be extended to find the LCM of two or more numbers.

## Finding Common Ground

Last year, we looked at common multiples, and common factors, and were also introduced to the amazing world of primes! In this chapter, we learnt a method to find the prime factorisation of a number. Finding all the factors of a number from its prime factorisation is easy but quite tedious — we have to list every possible subpart! The Highest Common Factor (HCF) is the highest among all the common factors of a group of numbers. = Every common factor is contained in the prime factorisation of the number. = To find the HCF, we include the minimum number of occurances of each prime across the prime factorisation of all the numbers. The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) is the lowest among all the common multiples of a group of numbers. = Every common multiple contains the prime factorisation of the numbers. = To find the LCM, we include the highest number of occurrences of each prime across the prime factorisations of all the numbers. We explored more about HCF and LCM; we discovered related properties and patterns when numbers are consecutive, even, co-prime, etc. We learnt a procedure to get both the HCF and the LCM at the same time! We also saw how to make this even quicker! We learned some terms that are used when discussing mathematics, such as ‘conjecture’ and ‘generalisation’.

The largest prime found so far has 4,10,24,320 digits! It was discovered on October 12, 2024.

## 4.2 Decimal Multiplication

(?) Example 1: Arshad goes to a stationery shop and purchases 5 pens. If one pen costs %9.5 (9 rupees and 50 paisa), how much should he pay the shopkeeper?

(?) What operation must we use here? We have to multiply 9.5 by 5, which is the same as adding 9.5, 5 times.

That is 9.5«5=9.5+95+9.5+95+9.5 =47.5. We can also directly multiply the numbers by converting them into

fractions. 9.5 is 95 and 5 is 3 as a fraction. 10 1 . ~ 5,95 The cost of 5 pens = 1% 40°

Recall that, to find the product of two fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. 5 95 _ 5x95 1 10 1x10 _ 475 ~ 10 = 47.5.

The cost of 5 pens is %47.5. Example 2: A car travels 12.5 km per litre of petrol. What is the distance covered with 7.5 litres of petrol? We have to multiply 12.5 by 7.5. The distance covered = 12.5 x 7.5

(?) By looking at the above examples, can you frame a rule to multiply two decimals?

Multiplication of decimals is the same as the multiplication of their corresponding fractions. When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators, respectively.

The product of the numerators = Product of the numbers with the decimal points removed.

Since both the denominators are of the form 1, 10, 100, 1000, ..., the product of the denominators is also of the form 1 followed by zeroes. The number of zeroes in the product is the sum of the number of zeroes in each denominator.

In the product, the decimal point is placed based on the total number of zeroes in the denominator.

So, to multiply two decimals, we can multiply the two numbers obtained by removing the decimal point, and then place the decimal point appropriately as shown below.

To evaluate 5.96 x 24.8:

596 x 248 = 147808

The sum of the number of digits after the decimal point in the multiplier and multiplicand is 3. So, the product is 7.192.

Verify this by converting the multiplier and multiplicand into fractions.

5.8 x 1.24


## Is the Product Always Greater than the Numbers Multiplied?

Recall multiplication of two fractions. Unlike counting numbers, when two fractions are multiplied the product is not always greater than or equal to both numbers. Let us examine the case of the product of two decimals.

2.25 x 8 = 18. In the above multiplication, the product (18) is greater than 2.25

and 8. But in, 0.25 x 8 = 2, the product (2) is greater than 0.25 but less than 8.

In the case of 0.25 x 0.8 = 0.2, the product (0.2) is less than both 0.25 and 0.8. ?) When is the product of two decimals greater than both the numbers? When is it less than both the numbers?

Since decimals are just representations of fractions, the relationship between the numbers multiplied and the product are similar to fractions.

Situation 1 Both numbers are greater The product (22.1) is greater than 1 (e.g., 3.4 x 6.5) than both the numbers.

Both numbers are between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.75 x 0.4)

Situation 2 The product (0.3) is less


## than both the numbers.


## Situation 3

One number is between 0 and 1 and one number is greater than 1 (e.g., 0.75 x 5)

The product (3.75) is less than the number greater than 1 and greater than the number between 0 and 1.

Since there are 10 pieces, we can find the length of each piece by dividing 3.9 by 10.

So, what is 3.9 + 10? 39

Let’s convert 3.9 into fraction 3.9 = 70° Fence, 9 + 10 is the same as dividing 2 2 by 10. Recall ‘hat, dividing a fraction by a divisor is the same as multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of the

equally with Anu. What is the length of A

ribbon that each of them will get?

Since the ribbon needs to be divided into two equal parts, each girl will get a piece of 29 + 2 metres.

If each of them gets 14 m, then 1 m remains. If we divide 1 m among the two,

each will get another ; m.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

We know that the fraction 2 can be represented as a decimal 0.5.

So, each girl will get 14 m and an additional 0.5 m of ribbon. Hence, the length of ribbon each will get is 14 + 0.5 = 14.5 m.

?) Now, what if the ribbon was shared between four friends instead of 2?

So, each will get 29 + 4m, that is 2 m.

Now, the denominator of the fraction is 4. To convert a fraction to a decimal, it helps if the denominator is of the form 1, 10, 100, 1000, and

so on. Can we find a fraction equivalent to a with such a denominator?

Is 4 a factor of 10? No. Is it a factor of 100? Yes. 4 x 25 = 100. So we

can get an equivalent fraction of a by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 25. 29x25 _ 725 4x25 100

So each of the 4 friends will get 7.25 m of ribbon.

= 7.25


## Division Using Place Value

We have seen how to divide two counting numbers to get a decimal quotient. We first represented the division as a fraction. Then we found an equivalent fraction, with the denominator being of the form 1, 10, 100, 1000, and so on. It was then easy to represent this equivalent fraction as a decimal.

Now, let us look at the division using place value procedure to calculate the decimal quotient.

?) Suppose we want to write the quotient 2 as a decimal. Can we convert

this fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator such as 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.?

It is not possible. So, we need a more general method to divide any two counting numbers. Let us see how we can use division using place value for this.

Let us start with a quick recap of division using place value.

## Division with a Decimal Divisor

Example 12: Ravi went from Pune to Matheran by scooter in 2.5 hours. The distance was 126 km. What was his average speed?

We can get the average speed by dividing the distance by the time

taken. 126 + 2.5.

When the divisor is a decimal, we convert the divisor into a fraction. 126 = 79 = 12655 25°

With the long division procedure we find the quotient is 50.4. So, the average speed at which Ravi travelled was 50.4 km per hour.

(?) Example 13: Find 4.68 = 1.3. Again converting the divisor into a fraction we get

13 _ 10 _ 46.8 4.68 + 10 4.68 x B13 Now, what about 4.68 + 0.13? 4.68 = 0.13 = 4.68 + 100 4.68 x 13 13°

?) What do you notice in these cases?

When the divisor is a decimal, we can convert it into a counting number by suitably multiplying it by 10, 100, 1000, and so on. We must also multiply the dividend by the same number. Thus,

4.68 _ 4.68100 _ 468 0.13. 0.13* 100 13°

Once we convert the divisor into a counting number, we can then

follow the division using place value procedure to find the quotient.

## Dividend, Divisor, and Quotient

When we divide two counting numbers, the quotient is always less than the dividend. For example, 128 = 4 = 32, and 32 (quotient) < 128 (dividend).

But what happens when we divide 128 by 0.4? 128 + 0.4 = 320. The quotient is greater than the dividend.

## 4.4 Look Before You Leap!

Did you know that it takes the Earth 365.2422 days to go around the Sun j Hey, and not 365 days? Forourconvenience, 3 Thave not we consider 365 days as a year in } yet finished! a calendar. We are talking about 3 Gregorian calendar.

This means that, after one calendar year or 365 days, the Earth still needs 0.2422 more days to complete one full revolution around the Sun. This doesn’t seem like much. But what happens after 100 such calendar years?

Using our understanding of decimal multiplication,

0.2422 x 100 = 24.22 days.

After 100 calendar years, the Earth will need 24.22 more days to complete its 100th revolution around the Sun.

In your Science classes, you have learnt that we experience seasons because of the Earth’s tilt in axis and its revolution around the Sun. If our calendar does not accurately indicate the position of the Earth around the Sun, our seasons and our annual calendar will not match!

To correct this problem, the idea of a leap year was introduced. Every fourth year, one additional day is added to the calendar year.

365 365 365 366 365 365 365 366

Looking at the above sequence, the number of days after 4 calendar years is 4x 365 + 1 = 1461 days. What is the number of days that the Earth needs to make 4 full revolutions around the Sun?

4 x 365.2422 = 1460.9688 days.

days. In 100 calendar years, the number of days is 100 x 365. But years that are divisible by 4 have one extra day.

?) How many years are divisible by 4 in 100 years? So, the number of days in 100 calendar years is, (100 x 365 + ” x 1) = 36,525 days. g@, (?) Can you form different expressions for the same question? G9) The actual number of days that the Earth takes to go around the Sun 100 times is, 100 x 365.2422 = 36,524.22 days.

around the Sun. We have overcompensated.

If we follow this new scheme of adding 1 day every four years, but not in the 100th year, the number of calendar days in 1000 years is 36524 x 10 = 3,65,240 days.

The number of days the Earth takes to go around the Sun 1000 times is 1000 x 365.2422 = 3,65,242.2 days.

So, there is a difference of 2.2 days.

In 1000 calendar years, how many years are divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 and 400? 250 - 10 = 240. The rest of the years are 1000 - (2 + 8 + 240) = 750.

So, the total number of days in 1000 calendar years is (750 x 365) + (240 x 366) + (8 x 365) + (2 x 366) = 3,65,242 days.

The Earth needs 3,65,242.2 days to go around the Sun 1000 times. Hence, in 1000 years, the calendar year is slightly shorter (by 0.2 days) than the actual number of days the Earth takes to go around the Sun.

The calendar makers did not want to bother about a small difference that would happen in 1000 years! So, they left the scheme of leap years as is...

oe SUMMARY }..-.-------------------~

In this chapter, we learnt procedures to perform decimal multiplication and division.

For decimal multiplication, we first multiply the multiplier and multiplicand as counting numbers. The number of decimal digits in the product is the total number of decimal digits in the multiplier and multiplicand.

Division of decimals uses the same procedure, ie., division using place value (long division), as with counting numbers. The regrouping continues after the Ones place to Tenths, Hundredths, Thousandths, and so on. When the Ones are regrouped to Tenths, a decimal point is placed in the quotient.

There are decimal divisions where the quotient never ends. After each regrouping and dividing there is always a remainder!

## 5.1 Of Questions and Statements

Your teacher tells you that they are meeting two of their childhood friends this evening. One is 5 feet tall and the other is 6 feet tall. What is your guess as to each friend’s gender based on this information?

You might have guessed that the 5-foot-tall person is a woman and the 6-foot-tall person is a man. There is a chance that you are wrong. But experience tells us that 5-foot-tall men and 6-foot-tall women are rare. We have seen that, more often, men are taller than women.

The above is a simple example of statistical thinking. We regularly come across statements like —

Jemimah’s batting has I take about been very consistent over 15 minutes the past year. We can to cycle from expect a century from her school to home. in tomorrow’s match.

I think my pen might last for 2 more weeks; it is time to get a new one soon.

We call these statistical statements. Simply put, a statistical statement is a claim or summary about some phenomenon, expressed in terms of numerical values, proportions, probabilities, or predictions.

A statistical question is a question that can be answered by collecting data. For example, “How tall are Grade 7 students in our school?” is a statistical question. We expect that not all Grade 7 students have the same height, but we can collect data, analyse it, and make conclusions about the heights that do occur. The question “Typically, are onions costlier in Yahapur or Wahapur?” is also a statistical question. Prices can vary over time. Therefore, answering this question requires us to look at data, analyse it, and come to conclusions making suitable statistical statements.

?) Which of the following are statistical questions?

(a) What is the price of a tennis ball in India?

(b) How old are the dogs that live on this street?

(c) What fraction of the students in your class like walking up a hill? (d) Do you like reading?

(e) Approximately how many bricks are in this wall?

(f) Who was the best bowler in the match yesterday? (g) What was the rainfall pattern in Barmer last year?

The term statistics refers to the study of collecting, organising, analysing, interpreting, and presenting data. In this chapter, we shall encounter some statistical questions and learn how analysing data and graphs can help answer them.


## 5.2 Representative Values

The runs scored by Shubman and Yashasvi in a cricket series are given in the table below. Who do you think performed better?

0 17 21 90 67 55 18 35

Shreyas says, “Both their performances are similar since Yashasvi scored more in the first and second matches, whereas Shubman scored more in the third and fourth”.

10/9/2025 3:45:41 PM


## Connecting the Dots...

Vaishnavi says, “I think Shubman performed better because he scored the highest number of run in a match— 90!”.

Shreyas says, “No! Yashasvi batted better since the total number of runs he made is 175, while Shubman made only 128”.

Vaishnavi says, “Oh! Also, Yashasvi’s batting is more consistent— the difference between his maximum score and minimum score is lower”.

The table below shows the runs scored by these two players in another series. Who do you think performed better in this series?

Vaishnavi says, “Here, Shubman performed better since his total is 110 runs, while Yashasvi’s total is 96 runs”.

(©) What do you think of Vaishnavi’s statement?

Shreyas says, “But Yashasvi made 96 runs in 4 matches and Shubman made 110 runs in 5 matches”.

So, how do we say who performed better’? It is often not simple to compare two groups of numbers and clearly say that one is better than the other.

(?) Can a single number act as a representative of a group of numbers? nati For example, can we represent Shubman’s or Yashasvi’s batting in this series with one number? Discuss. We saw one way already — the total of the values in the group! But, if the group sizes are different, then the total may not be an appropriate measure to compare. In some matches, a player could have scored more and in other matches less. A representative number for the group can be found by balancing out these highs and lows. For example, we can add up the runs scored in all the matches and divide the total by the number of matches played. We call this value the ‘average’ or ‘arithmetic mean’ of the given data. Here, the average number of runs scored by a player in a match = [Total runs scored by the player in all the matches] + [Number of matches played]. Average number of runs scored by Shubman in a match = 110 + 5 = 21 runs. Average number of runs scored by Yashasvi in a match = 96 + 4 = 24 runs. Inthis series, Yashasvi’s average number ofrunsis higher than Shubman’s.

Average as Fair-Share The average can also be understood as fair-share or equal-share.

?) Shreyas and 4 of his friends have collected the following numbers of guavas: 3, 8, 10, 5, and 4. Parag and 5 of his friends have collected the following numbers of guavas: 5, 4, 6, 3, 4, and 8. Each group will share their guavas equally amongst themselves. In which group will each member get a bigger share of guavas?

To find this out, we first find out how many guavas each group has collected. Then we divide this total by the number of people in the group to get each member’s share.

Shreyas’s group has collected 3 + 8 + 10 + 5 + 4 = 30 guavas. Each member of Shreyas’s group gets 30 + 5 = 6 guavas.

Parag’s group has collected 5 + 4+ 6+3+4+ 8 = 30 guavas. Each member of Parag’s group gets 30 + 6 = 5 guavas.

So, the members of Shreyas’s group get 1 more guava each than the members of Parag’s group.

On an average, 5 Hibiscus flowers bloom daily.

In this case the average tells us the number of flowers blooming each day, if an equal number of flowers bloomed daily.

One of the terms used for the Arithmetic Mean in ancient Indian mathematics is samamiti (mean measure): ‘sama’ means equal. Some terms used for the Arithmetic Mean in Indian texts include — samarajju (mean measure of a line segment) by Brahmagupta (628 CE), samikarana (levelling, equalising) by Mahaviracarya (850 CE) sdmya (equality, impartiality, equability towards) by Sripati (1039 CE) and samamiti (mean measure) by Bhaskaracarya (1150 CE) and Ganesa (1545 CE). The terminology shows that ancient Indian scholars perceived the Arithmetic Mean as the ‘common’ or ‘equalising’ value that is a representative measure of a collection of values.


## (?) Figure it Out

1. Shreyas is playing with a bat and a ball— but not cricket. He counts the number of times he can bounce the ball on the bat before it falls to the ground. The data for 8 attempts is 6, 2, 9, 5, 4, 6, 3, 5. Calculate the average number of bounces of the ball that Shreyas is able to make with his bat.

2. Try the activity above on your own. Collect data for 7 or more attempts and find the average.

3. Identify a flowering plant in your neighbourhood. Track the | number of flowers that bloom every day over a week during its flowering season. What is the average number of flowers that bloomed per day?

4. Two friends are training to run a 100 m race. Their running times over the past week are given in seconds — Nikhil: 17, 18, 17, 16, 19, 17, 18; Sunil: 20, 18, 18, 17, 16, 16, 17. Who on average ran quicker?

Khushboo: ‘I think Wahapur is costlier because it has the highest price of %60.’

Nafisa: ‘I added the prices of all months in each location - Yahapur’s total is 458, whereas Wahapur’s total is 450.’

Vishal: ‘Wahapur is costlier since it has 3 numbers in the 50s’.

Sampat: ‘I compared the prices in each month in both locations. Prices in Yahapur are higher for 6 months, prices in Wahapur are higher for 5 months, and the prices are the same for 1 month. So, I feel Yahapur is costlier’

Jithin: ‘I noticed that the difference between the highest and lowest prices in Yahapur is 59 — 24 = 35, and in Wahapur it is 60 — 17 = 43,’

Data can be described and compared by referring to its minimum value, maximum value, the average value, the sum total of all its values, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

(?) Can you think of any other ways to compare the data?

To study data, we can visualise it in multiple ways. One way is shown below — it is called a dot plot. Dot plots show data points as dots ona line, helping us visualise variability and patterns in data. In the following figure, each dot represents the monthly price of onions.

?) Does this visualisation capture all the data presented in the tables earlier?

(©) Looking at it, can we tell the price of onions in Yahapur in the month of January?

This method of presentation orders or sorts the data, but it loses the original (month-wise) sequence of the values. However, it allows us to group the data however we wish, just as Vishal did. For instance, there are 2 data values between 11-20 for Wahapur, while Yahapur has none. This representation makes it easier to observe the variation in the data — where and how the data is clustered or spread out. We can easily see that the prices in Wahapur are more spread out than those in Yahapur. It is also easy to spot the highest and lowest values.

We can also use the average as one of the ways to compare the prices at these two places.

## Height of a Family

The heights of the family members of Yaangba and Poovizhi are as follows:

Yaangba’s family: 169 cm, 173 cm, 155 cm, 165 cm, 160 cm, 164 cm. Poovizhi’s family: 170 cm, 173 cm, 165 cm, 118 cm, 175 cm.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

The average height of Poovizhi’s family (160.2 cm) is less than that of Yaangba’s family (164.3 cm). Although most members in Poovizhi’s family are taller, their family’s average height is less because one child is much younger and not as tall as the rest of the family. Their average height, 160.2 cm, is less than the heights of 4 out of 5 members. Here, the average doesn’t seem to represent the data very well.

115 125 135 145 155 165 175

?) Can you think of any other number that can represent the data better?

One way is to sort the data and pick the number in the middle. This number is called the Median.

To find the median height of Poovizhi’s family, we first sort the heights —

118, 165, 170, 173, 175.

The middle number in this sorted data is 170. Therefore, the median height is 170 cm.

Let us find the median height of Yaanghba’s family. Sorting the heights, we get

155, 160, 164, 165, 169, 173.

Since the median is the number in the middle, it will have an equal number of values less than it and greater than it. This data does not have a single middle number because it has an even number of values (6). In such cases, we take the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted data. Therefore, the median height of Yaangba’s family is (164 + 165) + 2

= 164.5 cm. be * + Mean = 164.3 — f Median = 164.5 - - - 115 125 135 145 155 165 175 e o_o e¢ Mean = 160.2 — i Median = 170 - -- 115 125 135 145 155 165 175

In this case, does the median represent the heights of the families better than the average?


## Woe

10/9/2025 3:45:43 PM


## Connecting the Dots...

In Poovizhi’s family, the height of the youngest child is quite different from the heights of the rest of the family. We call such a value an outlier. Outliers are values which significantly deviate from the rest of the values in the data.

Notice how the mean and the median are close to each other in Yaangba’s data, in the absence of any outlier.

In Poovizhi’s data, because of the outlier, the mean is much lower than the median.

(?) Find the mean and median in Poovizhi’s data without the outlier value 118. What change do you notice?


## Are you a bookworm?

?) After the summer vacation, a class teacher asked his class how many short stories they had read. Each student answered the number of stories read on a piece of paper, as shown below. Find the mean and median number of short stories read. Before calculating them, can you guess whether the mean will be less than or greater than the median?

Mark the data, the mean, and the median on the dot plot below.

The median value 6 means that half of the class members have read 6 or more stories.


## Chapter-5.indd 107

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II (©) Which of the values would you consider an outlier?

(?) Find the mean and median in the absence of the outlier. What change do you notice?

The average may not always be an appropriate representative of data that has outliers. A very high or a very low outlier can significantly impact the sum, thus affecting the average. For example, the 118 cm height in Poovizhi’s family is an outlier at the lower end of the data. And the count of 40 short stories read is an outlier at the higher end of the data. In these cases, we saw that the median was not affected much by the outliers.


## Are We on the Same Page?

Do you read newspapers? Have you noticed how many pages a newspaper has on different days of the week — is it the same or different?

The list below shows the number of pages for a particular newspaper from Monday to Sunday: 16, 18, 20, 22, 26, 16, 10.


## Mark the data, the mean, and the median on the

dot plot below. | + i 0 5 10 15 20 25

(©) In the three examples we considered — the heights, short-stories, and newspaper pages — observe the variability in data when:

(a) the mean and median are close to each other

(b) the mean and median are comparatively far apart, with mean < median

(c) the mean and median are comparatively far apart, with mean > median

When the data is more balanced or uniformly spread out the mean, and the median appear to be close to each other. When the outlier is on the lower end, the mean appears to shift in that direction, ie., mean < median. When the outlier is on the higher end, the mean appears to shift in that direction, i.e., mean > median.

## Connecting the Dots...

?) Discuss the effect on the mean and median when outliers are Mat +I present on both sides. You may take some example data to examine and explain this.

Mean and Median are called measures of central tendency, i.e., the tendency of the values to pile up around a particular value. In other words, they represent the ‘centre’ of the data.


## Of Ends and the Essence

As we have just seen, the mean and the median can give different perspectives on the data. As part of analysing data, it can also be valuable to look at the variability in the given data, ie., its extremes (minimum and maximum values).


## How Tall is Your Class?

Suppose you are asked the question, “How tall is your class?” What would you say?

The table below shows the heights of students in a Grade 5 class in centimeters.

147, 135, 130, 154, 128, 135, 134, 158, 155, 146, 146, 142, 140, 141, 144, 145, 150

143, 136, 150, 144, 154, 140, 145, 148, 156, 150, 150

We can visualise the data using a dot plot, identify the ends and patterns, and look at the variability. We can also find the measures of central tendency. The dot plot for the whole class, followed by the dot plots for boys and girls, respectively, are shown. The mean and the median are also shown for each collection.

## Chapter-5.indd 109


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

(©) What can we infer from the dot plots and the central tendency measures?

The following points can help answer the question of how tall the class is.

e The boys’ heights are more spread out and are between 128 and 158. The girls’ heights lie between 136 and 156. Both the tallest and shortest in the class are boys.

e Yet, the boys’ average height is less than the whole class average, and also less than the girls’ average height. We can say girls are taller than boys in this class. Of course, this doesn’t mean every girl is taller than every boy!

e For boys’ heights, mean < median (142.94 < 144) indicating a small influence of values on the lower side. For girls’ heights too, mean < median (146.9 < 148) indicating a small influence of values on the lower side.

Zero Median Runs Scored! In a cricket match, can a team’s median runs scored by a player be 0 but the team’s total score be 407/10?

In yesterday’s match, the median runs scored by England’s players was 0, and yet the team scored 407 for the loss of 10 wickets.

Carse 0, Josh To! ehoaib Bashir Qaeaay xtras; Akash Deep 4/88, um, Siraj 6/70),

Accounting for the extras, the average runs scored by a player in this innings is (407 - 19) + 11 = 35.27.


## Zero vs. No value

Suppose a player scores 57, 13, 0, 84, —, 51, 27 ina series. Notice that the player played Match 3 and scored 0 runs whereas the player did not play Match 5. So, we consider the total number of matches to be 6 and not 7. We calculate their average runs scored per match as (57+13+0+84+51+27)+6.

Sita has a mango tree in her backyard. The number of mangoes the tree gave every month over the last year, from January to December, is 0, 0, 8, 24, 41, 16, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 respectively. If we want to find the mean or median number of mangoes per month, it would be appropriate to consider only the (Summer) months when mangoes are expected to grow.

¢ The average number of daylight hours per day in City 2 decreases from January, reaching a minimum of about 9 hours in June. It then increases, reaching a maximum of about 15 hours in December.

¢ The maximum and minimum values in City 1 are more extreme than those of City 2. That is, the maximum number of daylight hours per day of City 1 is more than that of City 2, and the minimum number of daylight hours per day of City 1 is less than that of City 2.

¢ InJune, City 1 experiences daylight for about 3th of the full day (24 hours), whereas during December-—January, it only experiences daylight for about zth of the full day.

(?) Does this give some idea of where these two cities are located?

City 1 and City 2 are located away from the Equator in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively. City 1 is Helsinki, Finland, and City 2 is Wellington, New Zealand. These are also shown on the map. In June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, resulting in longer daylight hours; it is summertime here. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, leading to shorter days; it is winter time here. The inverted seasonal daylight pattern is due to the cities’ location in opposite hemispheres. The large variation in the data is because they are away from the Equator.

## Runs per over

The horizontal line lists the overs starting from 1, and the vertical line indicates the runs scored in each over. The graph shows the number of runs scored per over as a double bar graph — each bar corresponding to a team. Let us call them the blue team (denoted by blue) and the red team (denoted by red). The scale used for the runs per over is 1 unit = 5 runs. The circles shown on top of the bars indicate that a wicket fell in that over.

?) Answer the following questions based on the graph:

1. Can we tell who batted first? Who won the match?

2. How many runs did the blue team score in over 12?

3. In which over did the red team score the least number of runs? 4. Is it easy to tell the target set by the team batting first?

Looking at this data, you might wonder:

“Why is there a considerable difference in heights in the same grades


## across these two schools?”

“Where are these schools located?”

“How tall are students in Grades 6 to 8 in my school?” “What is the average height of all Grade 6 boys and girls?”

We see that men are taller than women in general. But what about the heights of boys and girls? Are boys taller than girls? Well, just by looking at the data of one or two schools, we cannot generalise for all children in our country, or around the world.

Let us look at some data (based on a survey) of the heights of boys and girls of different ages in India over time. The following table shows the average heights of boys and girls (in centimeters) across ages 5 to 19 in the years 1989, 1999, 2009, and 2019. In each year, the first column shows boys’ heights and the second column shows girls’ heights.

Dot plots help us get a quick glimpse of the variability of the data— minimum, maximum, range, and how data is clustered or spread out.


## Sum of all the values in the data

¢ The Arithmetic Mean = . Number of values in the data

¢ The Median is the number in the middle of any sorted data. If there are an even number of values, then the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

We can describe and compare data in several ways including by referring to the minimum, maximum, total, range, arithmetic mean, and median.

We learnt how to read and make clustered bar graphs. These graphs can be used to compare and visualise values across categories and across time.

¢ Examining data can lead to new questions and directions to probe further.

## CONSTRUCTIONS AND TILINGS

## 6.1 Geometric Constructions

Eyes Do you recall the ‘Eyes’ construction we did in Grade 6?

Of course, eyes can be drawn freehand, but we wanted to construct them so that the lower arc and upper arc of each eye look symmetrical.

We relied on our spatial estimation to determine the two centres, A and B (see the figure), from which we drew the lower arc and upper arc respectively.

The arcs define a line XY that ‘supports’ the drawing though it is not part of the final figure. We can start with this supporting line and systematically find the centres A and B.

For the eye to be symmetrical, or for the supporting line to be the line of symmetry, the upper and lower arcs should have the same radius. In other words, we must have AX = BX. Since AX = AY and BX = BY, this means


## AX = AY = BX = BY


## A


## We

## Constructions and Tilings

(©) How do we find such A and B? A

From X and Y, draw arcs above and below <x XY, with the same radii. The two points at which the arcs meet,

above and below XY, give us A and B, x Y respectively. Use this to construct an eye. X (?) In Fig. 6.1, join A and B with a line. Where Fig. 6.1 does AB intersect XY, and what is the angle A

formed between them?

We observe that AB passes through the midpoint of XY, and is also perpendicular to it. A division of a line, or any geometrical X Y object, into two identical parts is called bisection. A line that bisects a given line

and is perpendicular to it, is called the perpendicular bisector. B

?) Will the line joining the two points at which the arcs meet, above and below XY, always be the perpendicular bisector of XY, ie., when XY is of any length, and the arcs are drawn using a radius of any length?

This can be answered through congruence. Let us consider a line segment XY. Find points A and B such that AX = AY = BX = BY. Draw the lines AB, AX, AY, BX and BY. Let O be the point of intersection between AB and XY.

?) Which two triangles should be congruent for AB to be the perpendicular bisector of XY (that is, O is the midpoint of XY and AB is perpendicular to XY)?

If we show that AAOX = AAOY, then OX = OY, and ZAOX= ZAOY because they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. Since ZAOX and AOY together form a straight angle, we have ZAOX + ZAOY = 180°.


## A


## Common side

Thus, ZAOX = ZAOY = 90°. This establishes ‘. i that O is the midpoint of XY and AB is ~ perpendicular to XY. Sy


## B

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

In AAOX and AAOY, we already know that AX = AY, and AO is common


## to both triangles.

If we can show that ZXAO = “YAO then, by the SAS congruence condition, we can conclude that the triangles are congruent.

To show this, we observe that AABX = AABY. This is so because AX = AY, BX = BY, and AB is common to both the triangles.

Thus, we have ZXAB=/YAB,~ or ZXAO = ZYAO because they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles.

Hence, AB is the perpendicular bisector of XY.

We can have eyes of different shapes.

?) How do we get these different shapes? Try! x< One way is to choose two other points C and D such A that CX = CY = DX = DY. An eye of a different shape can be x drawn using these points. (?) Will C and D lie on the perpendicular bisector AB? x Ke Y The points C and D are at the same distance from both x X and Y. We have just seen that joining any two such B points gives the perpendicular bisector of XY. Since XY x has only one perpendicular bisector, which is the line AB, D

the points C and D must lie on the line AB.

?) Justify the following statement using the facts that we have established. Any point that has the same distance from X and Y lies on the perpendicular bisector of XY.

Thus, eyes of different shapes can be drawn by suitably choosing different pairs of points on the perpendicular bisector as centres to construct the upper and lower arcs of the eyes.


## Construction of Perpendicular Bisector

(©) Given a line segment XY, how do we draw its perpendicular bisector using only an unmarked ruler and a compass?

We have seen that joining any two points — one above XY and one below— that are at equal distances from X and Y, gives the perpendicular bisector of XY. This gives a method to construct the perpendicular bisector.

1. Taking some fixed radius, from X and then Y, construct two sufficiently long

arcs above XY. Name the point where the ————| arcs meet as A.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

2. Using the same radius, from A X and then Y, construct two sufficiently long arcs below XY. Name the point where the arcs meet as B. Xx Yy

3. ABis the required perpendicular bisector.


## B

Thus, the perpendicular bisector can be constructed using the simplest geometric tools— an unmarked ruler and a compass. We will use only these two tools for all the other geometric constructions in this chapter, unless there is a need for drawing lines of specific lengths in standard units.


## (?) Figure it Out

1. When constructing the perpendicular bisector, is it necessary to have the same radius for the arcs above and below XY? Explore this through construction, and then justify your answer.

{Hint 1: Any point that is of the same distance from X and Y lies on the perpendicular bisector.

Hint 2: We can draw the whole line if any two of its points are known.]

2. Is it necessary to construct the pairs of arcs above and below XY? Instead, can we construct both the pairs of arcs on the same side of XY? Explore this through construction, and then justify your answer.

3. While constructing one pair of intersecting arcs, is it necessary that we use the same radii for both of them ? Explore this through construction, and then justify your answer.

4. Recreate this design using only a ruler and compass —

After completing the above design, you can use a colour pencil with a ruler or compass to trace its boundary. This will make the design stand out from the supporting lines and arcs.

This method of constructing the perpendicular bisector is not only geometrically exact but also a practical way to construct it accurately.

This method to find the midpoint of a line segment is more accurate than measuring the length using a marked scale.


## Construction of a 90° Angle at a Given Point

Extend the line on either side of O.

Using a compass, mark two points X and Y at equal distance from O, so that O is the midpoint of XY. Fig. 6.2

The perpendicular bisector of XY will pass through O and is perpendicular to the given line.

In this case, do we need to draw two pairs of intersecting arcs to get the perpendicular bisector of XY?

No, we don’t. We already have one point, O, lying on the perpendicular bisector.

## Construction Methods in Sulba-Siitras

Ancient mathematicians from different civilizations, including India, knew exact procedures to construct perpendiculars and perpendicular bisectors.

In India, the earliest known texts containing these methods are the Sulba-Sitras. These are geometric texts of Vedic period dealing with the construction of fire altars for rituals. The Sulba-Sutras are part of one of the six Vedangas (a term that literally means ‘limbs of the Vedas’). The Sulbas contain the methods that we developed earlier to construct a perpendicular and the perpendicular bisector. All the construction

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

methods in the Sulba-Sitras make use of a different kind of compass from what you would have used— a rope. A rope can be used to draw circles or arcs. It can also be stretched to form a straight line.

In addition, the Sulba-Sutras also contain other methods to construct perpendicular lines. Here is an interesting construction of the perpendicular bisector using a rope (Katyayana-Sulbasitra 1.2).

Let XY be the given line segment, drawn on the ground, for which we need to construct a perpendicular bisector. Fix a small pole or peg vertically into the ground at each point X and Y.

Take a sufficiently long rope. Make two loops at its ends. Without taking into account the parts of the rope that has gone into the loops, fold the rope into half to find and mark its midpoint.

Fasten the two loops at the ends of the rope to the poles at X and Y.

Pull the midpoint of the rope above XY, as shown in the figure, such that the two parts of the rope on either side are fully stretched. Mark this position of the midpoint as A.

Now similarly pull the midpoint of the rope below XY, as shown in the figure, such that the two parts of the rope on either side are fully stretched. Mark this position of the midpoint as B.

AB is the required perpendicular bisector.

## Angle Bisection for a Design

(?) How do we construct this figure?

Fig. 6.5

The supporting lines for this figure will look like this.

?) What is the angle between two adjacent lines? We need the angle between every pair of adjacent lines to be equal. Since 360° is equally divided into 8 parts, every angle is 45°. ?) How do we construct a 45° angle using only a ruler and a compass?

We know how to construct a 90° angle. If we can divide it into two equal parts, or bisect it, then we get a 45° angle.

Xx We will now develop a general method to bisect any angle. Consider an angle 7XOY. ) Y x We can bisect it if we can draw two congruent B

triangles AOBC and AOAC as shown in the figure. Then “BOC = ZAOC.


## Chapter-6.indd 143


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

(©) How do we construct these congruent triangles, given the angle? If A and B are marked such that OA = OB, and if C is chosen such that BC = AC, then by the SSS congruence condition, AOBC = AOAC. So we can bisect an angle as follows.

Steps for Angle Bisection x B 1. Mark points A and B such that OA = OB. ° A Y 2. Choosing any sufficiently long radius, cut x arcs from A and B, keeping the radius B c same. Mark the point of intersection as C. 3. OC bisects ZAOB. 6 A Y

So, a 45° angle can be constructed by first constructing a 90° angle and then bisecting it.

Suppose there is a line m to which we need a to draw a parallel line. We construct a line | A m that intersects m. Line | will serve as a transversal to line m and to the line parallel to Fig. 67

## Regular Hexagons

Recall that a regular polygon has equal sides and equal angles. A regular polygon with 3 sides is an equilateral triangle, and a regular polygon with 4 sides is a square. We have constructed these figures earlier.

?) How do we construct a regular pentagon (5-sided figure) and a regular hexagon (6-sided figure)? To begin with, try to construct a D pentagon and hexagon with equal sidelengths.

To construct a regular pentagon, we first need to have a better understanding of triangles and pentagons. We will discuss this in later years. However, constructing a regular hexagon is within our reach!

?) Can we break a regular hexagon into smaller pieces that can be constructed?

Regular Hexagon and Equilateral Triangles What happens when we join the ‘opposite’ points ofa - B regular hexagon? Since a regular hexagon has equal > <x

sides and angles, can we expect a figure like this? Will all the triangles in the figure be equilateral F <P> ¢

triangles? To answer these questions, we will reverse our D approach. Fig. 6.12

?) Can six congruent equilateral triangles be placed together as in Fig. 6.12? If yes, will it result in a regular hexagon?


## Chapter-6.indd 151


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

If six congruent equilateral triangles can indeed be placed as shown in Fig. 6.12, then the sides of the resulting hexagon are equal, and their angles are 60 + 60 = 120° (how?). So what we really need to examine is whether 6 congruent equilateral triangles can fit this way without overlapping and without leaving any gaps around the centre.

We have defined a degree by taking the complete angle around a point to be 360°. So all the angles around the centre should add up to 360°.

(?) Consider this figure. Will the 70° angle fit into the gap? What is the gap angle “AOI?

We have, 40° + 60° + 50° + 30° + 40° + 90° + gap angle = 360°.

Use this to determine whether the 70°angle fits the gap.

Thus, if there are angles that add up to 360°, their vertices can be joined together at a single point such that

(a) the angles do not overlap, and

(b) they completely cover the region around the point.

Since each angle in an equilateral triangle is 60°, six such angles add up to 360°. Therefore, six congruent triangles can be arranged as shown in Fig. 6.12.

?) In Fig. 6.12 can you explain why AOD, BOE and COF are straight lines?

?) Construct a regular hexagon with a sidelength 4 cm using a ruler and a compass.

A division of a line segment, or any geometrical quantity, into two identical parts is called bisection.

Any point that is of equal distance from the two endpoints of a given line segment lies on its perpendicular bisector. This property can be used to construct the perpendicular bisector using a ruler and compass.

The method of constructing the perpendicular bisector can be modified to draw a 90° angle at any point on a line using only a ruler and compass.

An angle can be bisected and copied using the congruence properties of triangles.

The figure shows the first 4 matchstick arrangements along with their position numbers in the sequence.

?) Jasmine decides to make a matchstick arrangement that appears in this sequence, using exactly 99 sticks. What will be the position number of this arrangement in the sequence?

To answer this question, it is useful to know the number of matchsticks in each position. We see that

the arrangement at position 1 has 2 x (1) + 1 = 3 matchsticks,

the arrangement at position 2 has 2 x (2) + 1 = 5 matchsticks,

the arrangement at position 3 has 2 x (3) + 1 = 7 matchsticks,


## and so on.

So, the n® position will have 2n+1 matchsticks.

To answer Jasmine’s question, we have to find the value of n such that 2n + 1 has the value 99, or, 2n+1=99.

(©) Can you find ways to get the value of n, such that 2n + 1 = 99? Talk

(?) Is it possible to make a matchstick arrangement that appears in this sequence using exactly 200 sticks? '

A statement of equality between two algebraic expressions is called an equation. Nowadays, when using symbols, we write an equation as two algebraic expressions with an equal sign ‘=’ between them.

Here are some more examples of equations:

3x+4=7,

20 =y-3,

3730s 2Z+4=5z-14 etc.

The process of finding the value(s) of the letter-rnumbers for which the equality holds, or for which the value of the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the equation becomes equal to the Right Hand Side (RHS) of the equation, is called solving the equation.

As we saw in the matchstick problem, framing an equation using an unknown quantity as a letter-number can help us find its value. an+1=99


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

(©) For the weighing scale problems in figures 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10, and 7.11, frame equations by using letter-numbers to denote the unknown weight.

For the problem in Fig. 7.6, let us denote the weight of one fried egg as e. Since each slice of bread is 2, we have 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 on one side and

e + eon the other side. Since they are equal, we have


## 6=e+e, or

2e = 6.

For the problem in Fig. 7.7, »- = 4, and we can denote the weight of one @ as y. So, we have 16 on one side, and 4 + 2y on the other side. Thus, we have the equation

4+ 2y=16.

(?) Solve the equations that you frame and check if you get the same value for the unknown weight as you got previously.

a2. Math (©) Frame 5 equations. Find methods to solve them. Talk


## 7.2 Solving Equations Systematically

How did you solve the various equations framed in the previous section? One way to solve an equation is to substitute different values in place of the letter-number and to check which value makes LHS = RHS. For example, consider the equation 2n + 1 = 99. If we substitute n = 5, we get LHS = 2 x (5) + 1 = 11. It is far away from


## 99, the RHS.

We can try n= 10. The LHS is 21. It is still not equal to 99.

Can we try n = 30? The LHS is now 61, still much lower than 99.

Let us try n = 40. The LHS is 81. We are getting closer to 99.

When n = 50, the LHS is 101. This is just a bit too high.

When n = 49, the LHS is 99!

Therefore, the solution to the equation 2n + 1=99 isn = 49.

?) Can this equation have any other solution? This method is called the trial and error method. The trial and error method can be inefficient.

(?) Try solving 5x — 4 = 7 using trial and error.

10/9/2025 3:19:56 PM


## Chapter-7.indd 169


## Finding the Unknown

Recall that in the case of the weighing scale, we didn’t use the trial and error method! For some problems, finding the solution was straightforward. For others, we used the fact that when we remove equal weights from both the plates of a balanced weighing scale, it remains balanced. Do equations have a similar property?

?) Consider an equation 15 + 8 = 23. If we add, subtract, multiply or divide the same number on both sides, will it still preserve the equality of LHS and RHS?

For example, you can check by adding 10 to both sides.

Since the LHS and the RHS of an equation have the same value, performing the same operation on both sides will clearly not change their equality.

In the weighing scale problems, we removed equal weights so that all the unknown weights were on only one plate of the scale. This made the problem easier to solve. We can use this same strategy to solve an equation as well! Let us first solve some arithmetic problems.

Example 1: It is known that 14593 — 1459 + 145 — 14 + 88 = 13353. What is the value of 14593 — 1459 + 145 — 14? To find the value, do we need to evaluate 14593 —- 1459 + 145 -14? No, we can get it by subtracting 88 from 13353. (?) Why can we do this?

We can do this because addition and subtraction are inverse operations. So, the value of the required expression can be found by subtracting 88 from both sides (LHS and RHS), which removes the term 88 and leaves only the expression to be evaluated on the LHS.

14593 — 1459 + 145 — 14 + 88 - 88 = 13353 - 88 Example 2: It is known that 23 x 41 x 11 x 8 x 7 = 5,80,888. What is the


## value of the expression 23 x 41 x 11 x 8?

Using the fact that multiplication and division are inverse operations, we can simply divide 5,80,888 by 7 to get the value of the expression.

(?) Is this the same as dividing both sides by 7, which removes the Ma a] factor 7 and leaves only the expression to be evaluated on the LHS?

Example 3: It is known that 12345 — 5432 + 135 — 24 — (-67) = 7091. What is the value of the expression 12345 — 5432 + 135 - 24?

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

This problem also can be solved using the fact that addition and subtraction are inverse operations. However, we can use the following method that is perhaps easier to visualise.

To retain only the expression to be evaluated on the LHS, we need to remove the term —(-67). We can remove this term by adding (-67) to both sides of the equation.

12345 — 5432 + 132 - 24 -(-67) + (67) = 7091 + (-67) 12345 — 5432 + 132 -24- (-67) + (67) = 7091 + (-67) Thus, 12345 — 5432 + 132-24 = 7024.

What can we do so that 5x is on one side and the equality between the LHS and the RHS still holds?

To retain only 5x on the LHS, we need to remove the term — 4. This can be done by adding 4 to both sides. Thus, 5x-4+4=7+4, Hence, 5x = 11.

To retain only the unknown x on the LHS, we need to remove the factor 5. This can be done by dividing both sides by 5.

## Finding the Unknown

(©) Can we check that x = 2 is the correct solution to the equation?

We can check this by substituting x with the value = in the equation 5x -4 = 7, and checking if the LHS = RHS. Substituting x with 2 in the LHS we get,

LHS = 5(%)- 4

“«(2)-s =11-4 =7

This is the same as the RHS.

So, = is indeed the correct solution to the equation.

(?) Example 5: Solve the equation 11y + (-5) = 61. To retain only the unknown term 11y on one side, we need to remove the term —5. This can be done by subtracting (-5) from both sides. diy + (-5) - 5) = 61 -(-5). That is, 11y = 66.

We can directly find the value of y, seeing that 11 x 6 = 66. We can also divide both sides by 11 to find y.

1ly +11 = 66+ 11. So y = G6 is the solution to the equation 11y + (-5) = 61. Can you check that this solution is correct?

(?) Example 6: Solve 6y + 7 = 4y + 21. In this equation, expressions with an unknown are on both sides.

?) We have seen how to solve equations when the unknown term is on one side. What can be done to bring the unknown terms to the same side? Subtracting 4y from both sides, we get 6y + 7—-4y = 4y + 21-4y. So, 2y+7=21.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

Subtracting 7 from both sides we get 2y + 7-7 = 21-7, which gives 2y = 14. We can directly find the value of y, seeing that 2 x (7) = 14. We can also divide both sides by 2 to find y. 2y + 2 = 14+ 2, which gives y=.

The procedure to systematically solve an equation can be made efficient if we make an observation. Consider the equation 11y + (-5) = 61, which we solved.

As the first step, we subtracted — 5 from both sides to remove the term -5. 11y + (5)-(-5) = 61-5).

Since this action removes the term — 5 from the LHS, we could have

written this step as: 11y = 61 -(-5).

Note that we could also have arrived at this step by seeing addition and subtraction as inverse operations, as in the case of Example 1.

Similarly, when we had 11y = 66, we divided both sides by 11 to remove the factor 11 from the LHS.

1ly+11=66+ 11.

## Finding the Unknown

Since this action removes the factor 11 in the LHS, we can write this step as: y=66+11. Again, we could have arrived at this by seeing multiplication and division as inverse operations, as in the case of Example 2. Let us write down both these ways of solving an equation.

lly + (-5)=61 lly +(-5)=61 11y + (-5)-(-5) = 61-(-5). lly = 61-(-5)

11ly = 66 11ly = 66 lly +11=66+11 y=66+11

Let us consider another equation that we solved earlier.

## yal yaT

(?) What happens in cases like 15 = 6?

Multiplying both sides by 15 leaves only u in the LHS — u=6x15 u= 90. Thus, we can make the following observations —

(a) When aterm that is added or subtracted on one side of an equation is removed from that side, its additive inverse should appear as a term on the other side for the equality to hold. For example, 2y + 7 = 21 becomes 2y = 21-7.

(b) If one side of an equation is the product of two or more numbers or expressions, and we remove one of the factors, then the other side should be divided by this factor for the equality to hold. For example, 2y = 14 becomes y = 14 + 2.

(c) If one side of an equation is the quotient of two numbers or expressions, and we remove the divisor, then the other side should be multiplied by this divisor for the equality to hold. For example,

is7 6 becomes u = 6 x 15.

We have the expression 3k + 1 which gives the number of tiles needed to make an arrangement in Step k.

To check whether an arrangement is possible using 100 tiles at some Step k, we can solve the equation: 3k + 1 = 100. Find the value of k.

(?) Example 8: Madhubanti wants to organise a party. She decides to buy snacks for the party from the chaat shop in town. Each plate of snacks costs $25. The shop charges an additional fixed amount of 50 to deliver the snacks to Madhubanti’s house.

There are 5 members in Madhubanti’s family, including herself. Her parents tell her she can spend £500 on this party. How many friends can she invite to the party if she wants to give a plate of snacks to each person, including her family and friends?

Fatima’s method of solving this problem is shown below. She represented the situation using a rough diagram.

asx [_]| |+50 u-__

Out of @500, if we subtract the fixed delivery charge, then Madhubanti is left with %450.

So the question becomes “How many plates of snacks, each costing %25, can be bought for %450?”. The answer to this is 450 = 25 = 18.

18 plates of snacks can be bought for 450. Considering her 5 family members, she can invite 18 — 5 = 13 friends to her party.


## Chapter-7.indd 175


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 | Part-II

Mahesh represented the unknown

quantity of the total number of people who can attend the party, including Madhubanthi


## and her family members, as p.

Cost incurred = 25p + 50. Since this cost should be 500, we have the equation 25p + 50 = 500. Subtracting 50 from both sides, we get 25p = 500-50. 25p = 450. Dividing both sides by 25, we get p=450+25=18. 18 people can be at her party,

including her 5 family members. That means 13 friends can be invited.

Srikanth decided to represent the unknown quantity of the total number of friends Madhubanthi can invite as f.

What will be the cost in this case?

Cost incurred = 25 (f+ 5). Since Madhubanthi has %450 for snacks, we have the equation

25 (f + 5) = 450. Dividing both sides by 25,

f+5=18. Subtracting 5 from both sides,

f= 13.

?) Example 9: Two friends want to save money. Jahnavi starts with an initial amount of #4000, and in addition, saves 650 per month. Sunita starts with $5050 and saves %500 per month. After how many months will they have the same amount of money?

Let m denote the number of months after which their savings are


## equal.

What are Jahnavi’s savings after m

months? Jahnavi’s savings = 4000 + 650m.

What are Sunita’s savings after

m months? Sunita’s savings = 5050 + 500m.


## Jahnavi ( 4000 + Goxm

As these amounts are equal after m months, we get the following equation:

4000 + 650m =

5050 + 500m

4000 + 650m — 500 m = 5050 (subtracting 500 m from both sides) 4000 + 150 m = 5050 150 m = 5050 — 4000 (subtracting 4000 from both sides)


## Equal

10/10/2025 4:29:05 PM


## Chapter-7.indd 177

150m = 1050


## Finding the Unknown

m = 1050 +150 (dividing both sides by 150)

m=7.

So, after 7 months, both will have the same amount of money.

Check the answer.

Let us solve a few equations.

(?) Example 10: Solve 28 (x + 4) + 300 = 1000. Here are some ways to solve this equation.

Subtracting 300 from both sides, we get

28 (x + 4) = 1000 - 300

28 (x + 4) = 700.

Dividing both sides by 28, we get

X+4=700 + 28 X+4=25. So x = 25 —4, which gives x= 21.

28 (x + 4) + 300 = 1000

Since 28, 300, and 1000 are divisible by 4, we get a simpler equation if we divide both sides by 4.

28 (x +4) +300 1000 4 — 4

Using the rules of fraction addition, we get

28 (x+4) 300 _ 1000 4 4 4

7 (x + 4) +75 = 250

Subtracting 75 from both sides,

7(x+4)=175 7X + 28 =175

Subtracting 28 from both sides,

7X = 147

147 _ xX=—=

7 21.

28 (x + 4) + 300 = 1000 Simplifying the LHS,

28x + 112 + 300 = 1000 28x + 412 = 1000

Subtracting 412 from both sides, we get

28x = 1000 — 412 28x = 588

Dividing both sides by 28,

X = 588 + 28 X= 21.

Solution: If we think of these numbers as representing money, we can see that the total money is €250.

There are two terms that are adding to #250. The second term in the LHS, %75, is fixed and does not change. The value of the first term would change based on ‘x’. So we can think of 100 as the number of units and ‘x’ as the cost per unit. For instance, x could represent the cost of a plate of snacks and 75 could be the delivery charge.

Forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India. This area of mathematics was termed bijaganita, also now known as algebra. The word bija means seed. Just as a tree is hidden inside a seed, the answer to a problem is hidden inside an unknown number. Solving the problem is like helping the tree grow— step by step, we discover what is hidden.

We have seen Brahmagupta’s contributions to different areas of mathematics like integers and fractions. In Chapter 18 of his book Brahmasphutasiddhanta (628 CE), he also explained how to add, subtract, and multiply unknown numbers using letters — similar to how we use x or y today. This chapter was one of the earliest known works in algebra in history. As renowned mathematician and Fields Medalist David Mumford remarked, ‘Brahmagupta is the key person in the creation of algebra as we know it’.

In the 8th century, Indian mathematical ideas were translated into Arabic. They influenced a well-known mathematician named Al-Khwarizmi, who lived in present-day Iraq. Around 825 CE, he wrote a book called Hisab al-jabr wal-muqabala, which means ‘calculation by restoring and balancing’.

These ideas spread even further. By the 12th century, Al-Khwarizmi’s book was translated into Latin and brought to Europe, where it became very popular. The word al-jabr from his book gave us the word algebra, which we also still use today.

Similar to how we use letters from the alphabet today to represent unknowns, ancient Indian mathematicians from the time of Brahmagupta used distinct symbols like ya, ka, ni, pi, lo, etc., for different unknowns. The symbol ya was short for ydvat-tavat (meaning ‘as much as needed’). Others like ka and ni referred to as the first letters

of the names of colours— kédlaka (black), nilaka (blue), and so on. In contrast to these unknowns, the known quantities in an expression had a specific form (rupa) and were denoted by ru.

Here are some examples of how algebraic expressions in modern notation were written in ancient Indian notation:

2x+1 ya2rii (in each term the indication of unknown/known came first)

2x-8 ya2ras (a dot over the number indicated that it was negative)

3x+4=2x+8 ya 3ru4 ya 2rus (the two sides of an equation were presented one below the other)

?) Example 16: Bijganita by Bhaskaracharya (1150 CE) mentions this problem.

One man has £300 rupees and 6 horses. Another man has 10 horses and a debt of 100. If they are equally rich and the price of each horse is the same, tell me the price of one horse.

Solution: Let price of one horse = = x According to the problem

300 + 6x = 10x - 100 300 + 6x + (100) = 10x 400 + 6x = 10x 400 = 10x — 6x 400 = 4x 400+4=x 100 =x Therefore, the price of one horse = = 100.

Such problems and solutions were well understood in ancient India. In fact, a very systematic way to solve problems with single unknowns was first proposed by Aryabhata (499 CE) and Brahmagupta has outlined it in his Brahmasphutasiddhanta (628 CE). Let us understand his method. Let us look at a few equations of the following form:

5x+4= 3x + 8, or 3x-6=2x+4.

(©) Can we come up with a formula to solve these equations? That is, for the first equation, can we perform some operations using 5, 4, 3, and 8 that will directly give us the solution? Using a similar method, can you solve the second equation using the numbers 3, — 6, 2 and 4?

To get a formula, we can generalise equations of this form by taking the four numbers as A, B, C, and D. That is,

Ax+B=Cx+D. Brahmagupta gives the solution to equations of this form with this formula: _ D-B A-C"

Using this approach, we can find the solution to the equation:

650m + 4000 = 500m + 5050 simply by calculating,

_ 3050 — 4000 650-500 ©

?) Using this formula can you solve this equation 2x + 3 = 4x + 5?

Ancient Indian mathematicians were excellent at converting complex mathematical ideas into simple procedures so that everyone could use these procedures to solve problems!

Bijaganita or algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses letter symbols to solve mathematical problems. We have seen some examples in previous pages. By studying algebra, we learn to generalise patterns— in numbers, shapes, and situations. We express these generalisations using the language of algebra, which is both precise and powerful.

Bijaganita also gives us a way to justify mathematical claims (like why the sum of two odd numbers is always even) and to solve problems of many kinds.

e An algebraic equation is a mathematical statement that indicates the equality of two algebraic expressions.

When the same operation is performed on both sides of an equation, equality is maintained.

Finding a solution to an equation means finding the values of the unknowns in the expressions such that the LHS is equal to the RHS.

Equations can often be solved by performing the same operation on both sides so that the value of the unknown becomes evident.


## Think of any number.

Now multiply it by 2.


## Add 10.


## Divide by 2.

Now subtract the original number you thought of: Finally, add 3.

I predict that you now have 8. Am I correct? Try the trick on your friends and family!

Can you explain why the trick works?

{Hint: Denote the first number thought of by x.] Can you make your own such tricks?
