Brahmagupta’s Rules for Multiplication and Division of Positive and Negative Numbers Just like for addition and subtraction of integers, Brahmagupta in his Brahmasphutasiddhanta (628 CE) also articulated explicit rules for integer multiplication and division. He used the notions of fortune (dhana) for positive values and debt (rna) for negative values. In his Brahmasphutasiddhanta (18.30-32), Brahmagupta wrote: “The product or quotient of two fortunes is a fortune. The product or quotient of two debts is a fortune. The product or quotient of a debt and a fortune is a debt. The product or quotient of a fortune and a debt is a debt.” This represented the first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated, and was an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra!", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}

We saw one way already — the total of the values in the group! But, if the group sizes are different, then the total may not be an appropriate measure to compare. In some matches, a player could have scored more and in other matches less. A representative number for the group can be found by balancing out these highs and lows. For example, we can add up the runs scored in all the matches and divide the total by the number of matches played. We call this value the ‘average’ or ‘arithmetic mean’ of the given data. Here, the average number of runs scored by a player in a match = [Total runs scored by the player in all the matches] + [Number of matches played]. Average number of runs scored by Shubman in a match = 110 + 5 = 21 runs. Average number of runs scored by Yashasvi in a match = 96 + 4 = 24 runs.
