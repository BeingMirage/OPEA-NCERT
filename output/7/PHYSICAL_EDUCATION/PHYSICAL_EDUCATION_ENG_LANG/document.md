The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pafichakoshas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8.

The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different

curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Researchand Training, onits part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. The book for Physical education and well-being, titled Khel Yatra for Grade 7, is meticulously designed to develop motor skills and engage children in the team sports of Badminton, Football and Kabaddi. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage.

Khel Yatra emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness.

The content and activities are designed to encourage peer group learning, and enrich the educational experience for both students and teachers. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore interesting local games and play with friends. This book is not only useful for school learning, but is a valuable resource for parents and community.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. Schoollibraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 (NCF-SE 2023) recognises the criticality of the health and well-being of individuals as a key factor for success in all aspects of life. Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 7. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities.

To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 7 textbook is designed to have five units.


## Foundational Basis of Physical Education and Well-being Physical Motor Fitness


## Fundamental Skills of Badminton


## Fundamental Skills of Football


## Fundamental Skills of Kabaddi


## Yoga


## i a

In Unit 1, students explore the connection between physical education (PE) and well-being, emphasizing its impact on personal and social

behaviour. Through playing games and engaging in discussions, students will understand the importance of living a healthy lifestyle and how physical activity adds to their overall enjoyment and success. Students will also learn about the safety measures to minimize the risk of injuries and create a healthy environment for the students.

In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health.

In the Units 3, 4 and 5 focus is on learning new games. Badminton is introduced in Unit 3, Football in Unit 4 and Kabaddiin Unit 5. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sport and health advantages of physical activity. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement.

In the last unit, students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogasanas starting with Sukshma Vyayama (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each asana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Pranayama strengthen the lungs, improves functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dharana (single pointed concentration) and Dhydna (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays foundation for long and healthy life.

In this book, apart from learning the games and physical activities, students will learn to follow rules, understand the importance of safe practices and fair play, work harmoniously in groups, treat each other with courtesy and respect, as well as, help each other, and

experience the joy of playing together. Inculcation of these values and dispositions will partly happen while children are engaged in the physical activities or games and partly, they will be reinforced during circle time after the game. Sufficient time must be given for circle time during the Physical Education and Well-being periods.


## Structure and Flow of Classes

NCF-SE 2023 has recommended 120 periods for physical education and well-being in Grade 7. Suggestive timetable assumes at least 5 periods of 40 minute each, per week. NCF-SE recommends allocating block period (2 periods together) for physical education and well- being. If it is not possible to allocate two block periods and one single period every week, it is necessary to design single periods with different focus to ensure sufficient time for activities, game and circle time.

Suggestions are given below for two different scenarios of timetable.


## ¢ Scenario 1 - Five single periods per week.

¢ Scenario 2 - Two block periods for Units 1 to 4 and single period for yoga.

Scenario 1: Three different types of sessions have been visualised to effectively use the limited time in each period and achieve the learning outcomes.


## e Typei: Maximizes game practice.

¢ Type 2: Maximizes circle time after play to provide sufficient time for discussing cognitive and socio-emotional aspects.

Type 3: Maximizes gamified drills to focus on one specific skill.

A sample time allocation for a 40-minute duration is given below for all types.


## Period/Session Types


## Warm-up — _ Game Time Preferably Gamified


## Warm-up — : Preferably Gamified —

Gamified Drills/ © _ Circle MiniGames _ Time

Scenario 2: (Highly Recommended) - A block period of 80 minutes can effectively maximize game practice, drills and circle time. Two types of sessions can be planned with block periods.

¢ Type 4: Maximizes game time and drills. ¢ Type 5: Maximizes game time.


## Type 4

Gamified Drill is a mini game played between teams to target specific

skills. Pure drills are not recommended at this stage.

For a joyful experience, safety of children and effective development of competencies, teachers may follow the instructions given below:

Ensure adequate play area and that there are no obstructions in the play area.

For group activities, mark the area into smaller blocks to prevent students from running into each other.

While dividing the teams, make sure that the teams are fair and balanced in terms of bodyweight, height and skills required for the activity.

Ensure that a first-aid kit is available and accessible.

Ensure that students are treated with respect and they feel emotionally and socially safe.


## Provide regular encouragement and support to all the students.

Ensure students have access to fair redressal of grievances during the Physical Education period.

Encourage students to be aware of their surroundings while playing. Instruct the students not to aim at the opponent.

Encourage the students to be careful while pushing or pulling the opponent in the activity.

Ensure that students do proper warm-up and cool-down. Encourage them to create their own routines.


## Provide opportunities to students for interactions before, during and after the class.

Introduce sports skills gradually. Complexity can be increased by playing mini versions of the sport gradually building individual capacities such as observation, reflection, emotional regulation, expanding spatial awareness and peripheral vision, and making quick judgements based on gameplay. Discuss social capacities such as effective communication, collective decision-making, and working together towards a common goal, during circle time and at relevant moments in the sport.

Encourage students to take more responsibility for building a culture of inclusive sports at school. Help them to take an active role in ensuring all students feel safe, motivated, and encouraged to play.

Three sports are offered in this book, teachers has to opt any two as per the feasibility.

Name of various sports introduced in this book are derived from various states, having different dilects. Teachers should encourage the students to learn correct pronunciation of these names.

¢ The objective of the students is to pick up the stones without being caught by the denner, who cannot enter the boxes but can move in this path.

e Students can collaborate or act independently to pick up the stones and distribute them amongst each other, with each student ultimately having one stone.

¢ Once all students have their stones, they ask the denner to choose either ‘Gumpw’ (Group) or ‘Chuttw’ (Circling).

e Ifthe denner chooses ‘Gumpu’, all students gather in one selected box with their stones.

e If the denner chooses ‘Chuttu’, each student must make three rounds around the boxes and return to their original position, while avoiding the denner’s touch.

¢ Students are out if they are touched by the denner while moving between boxes. The game continues until one student is out.

Focus on learning new skills and process of playing the game and not on the outcome of the game. This will help you grow mentally strong.

Kicking the Ball with the Inside of the Foot


## Basic moves and strategies

Kicking with the inside of the foot is a fundamental skill in football that many players use for passing, shooting and controlling the ball.


## Steps to Learn

You would have done similar activities in the Preparatory Stage (Grades 3 to 5). Let us learn the skill:

1. APPROACH ¢ Be in the direction of the ball.

Se +s Place the non-kicking foot pointing towards the target by the side (6 to 8 inches apart) of the ball.

2. EXECUTION OF THE SKILL

¢ The last step will be slightly bigger than the approach run. The kicking leg will get a good swing to connect the ball with the inside of the foot.


## Khel Yatra

02-Apr-25 4:05:37 PM

Lock your ankle in such a way that the toes are pointing outside, whereby the whole inside of the foot comes in contact with the ball while kicking.


## ¢ Connect your foot at the centre and behind the ball.

3. FOLLOW THROUGH

e Make sure your kicking foot is in the direction of the target after making contact with the ball.

Lead-up Activity Pair up with your partner and kick the ball toward each other with your instep. Gradually increase the distance to 3 m, then 5 m, and finally 7 m, while also practicing with a moving ball. You can only kick the ball with the inside of the foot. Your partner will score a point if you fail to kick the ball through your instep. Try to increase the speed of the rally to unsettle each other.

Receiving the ball using the inside of the foot is a fundamental skill in football that allows players to control and direct the ball effectively.


## Steps to Learn

You would have done similar activities in the Preparatory Stage (Grades 3 to 5). Let us learn the skill:

1. APPROACH

¢ Face the direction from which the ball is coming and align your body accordingly.

¢ Turn your shoulder and hips towards the direction of the passing to widen your body.


## Khel Yatra

2. EXECUTION OF THE TECHNIQUE

¢ Place your receiving foot in front of your standing leg and allow the ball to touch your foot.

To cushion the ball and slow it down, use the inside of your foot.

3. FOLLOW THROUGH ¢ At the time of contact with the ball, the receiving foot will be taken back so that the cushioning effect will be there to control the ball.


## Lead-up Activity

Pair with your partner, stand at a distance of 5 m and start kicking the ball towards each other with your inside of the foot. You have to receive the ball through your instep as explained. Make sure that you keep the ball in control while receiving. If the ball deflects while receiving, the shooter will score a point. Try to increase the speed of the rally to unsettle each other.

## eee =O

Passing a rolling ball in football is a fundamental skill that involves delivering the ball to a teammate with precision and control.


## Steps to Learn

You would have done similar activities in the Preparatory Stage (Grades 3 to 5). Let us learn the skill:

1. APPROACH

¢ Make sure your body is positioned correctly in relation to the ball.

e With your toes pointing in the direction of the pass, place your non-kicking foot next to the rolling ball.

¢ Look up to see where your opponents and teammates are positioned.

¢ You might need to modify the approach to better control the ball before passing if it is rolling fast.


## Khel Yatra

2. EXECUTION OF TECHNIQUE


## Physcial Education 7 - Unit 4.indd 91

Use your correct foot to strike the ball in order to pass efficiently; for a more controlled pass, use the inside of your foot.

You must strike the ball at the right time, ideally as it enters your stride.

Depending on how you choose to pass, change the angle of your foot.

Keep your foot parallel to the ground and slightly open for a more direct low pass.


## Fundamental Skills of Sports — Football

¢ The circumstances determine the pass's power, such as whether a longer driven pass or a short crisp pass is needed.

3. FOLLOW THROUGH

¢ Let your foot follow through in the direction of the pass after you've struck the ball.

e Make sure your body weight is evenly distributed to maintain your balance both during and after the pass.

¢ Make a swift transition to your next movement after the follow through.


## Drill Under Pressure

The goal is to pass the ball precisely and quickly as it rolls while the opposition puts pressure.

Mark a small area. Have three players pass the rolling ball to each other while one defender will intercept.

If the ball goes out of the small area, the person who kicks the ball will become the defender.

The defender will become the player.

## e Anticipate the direction, path and bounce of the ball.

¢ Take a low balanced position by bending your knees a little.

2. EXECUTION OF TECHNIQUE

¢ Ifthe ball is rolling towards you, simply place your foot directly on top of it to stop it.


## Fundamental Skills of Sports — Football

e If the ball is coming to you on a low bounce, extend your receiving foot in its direction and bring it back right before contact to stop the ball. Make sure that the ball dead drops on impact.

3. FOLLOW THROUGH

e Assoonasthe ballis trapped, get ready to transfer it into space or away from the defender.

e Make as many small boxes of 30 inches = 30 inches.

¢ Play this with your partner. One of the partners will stand behind the box and the other partner will roll the ball by hand towards the box from a distance of five metres.

¢ The partner behind the box has to trap the ball within the box. One point will be awarded for one trap.

¢ Each player will set a goal for trapping the ball, for example, five times out of six or three times out of six.

Feinting i _ opponent’s play |


## Steps to Learn

A feint usually involves a sudden shift of body weight, a fake dribble, or a head movement that suggests the player is going in one direction while they actually intend to go another way. The objective is to wrong-foot your opponent in order to make your way with or without the ball.

1. APPROACH

¢ With your knees bent and your body ready to change direction rapidly, maintain a low centre of gravity.

¢ Make it appear as if you are going to shoot, dribble, or pass ina single direction.

2. EXECUTION OF THE SKILL

e Use your entire body to make the feint seem realistic by exaggerating the movement of your legs and feet, as though you were going to pass or dribble in that direction.


## Khel Yatra

¢ Push off your planted foot and go in the opposite direction as soon as the opponent responds to your feint.

3. FOLLOW THROUGH

Once you've managed to trick the defender, speed into

the gap produced to move forward.

¢ Once you have defeated the defender, consider your alternatives. Your options will vary depending on the situation. Youcanshoot, dribble farther or pass.


## Lead-up Activity

Choose a partner for yourself. While the one player practices feints in front of other, the other player assumes the role of the defender. The attacker practices selling the feint and rapidly changing direction while the defender imitates the attackers moves rather than tackling.

## Kabaddi

Kabaddi is played between two teams, and the goal is to tag players. Players must touch opponents and return to their side of the court without getting caught. Kabaddi helps build strength, speed, and improves teamwork. It is a popular game in many countries and is also played in the Asian Games.


## Fundamental Skills of Sports — Kabaddi

Raiders perform offensive skills in the opponent’s half to touch the defenders and score points for their team.

## Lead-up Activity

Mark two parallel lines of 30 feet each (9.15 m). Set up two blocks 30 feet apart, opposite each line. Keep two blocks on the other side of the starting line. The player will stand at the starting line opposite the blocks. The player will start running towards the blocks as fast as possible on the signal ‘Ready? Go!’. They will pick up a block and return to place it behind the starting line, then run fast to pick up the second block, then run with it backwards across the line. The player who takes the minimum time to finish the activity will be the ‘winner’.

## Lead-up Activity

Make two teams (Team A and Team B) and ask the teams to stand away from the 10-metres line, keep a small ball in the centre of both lines. Every player is given a chest number (same number for both teams). When a number is called out, one player from both sides runs in and tries to take the ball placed in the centre to their side using hands only. The team that succeeds to score a point will be declared the winner.


## Note for the teacher

¢ The teacher should give different activities for the development of reaction and movement time, for example ruler drop.

## Lead-up Activity

Make two teams stand with their arms extended at the corners behind the bonus line. Both teams will line up in opposite sides of the court; first player will start at the whistle. The objective is that all team members will take turns to go to the opposite court, kick the extended arm and return in minimum time. The team that finishes first will be the winner.


## Khel Yatra


## DEFENSIVE SKILL

Some defensive positions are given below:


## Corners


## Centre


## Ins


## Covers

The players of the team stand on the extreme right and left corner on the kabaddi court. The responsibility of the corners is to initiate tackles. When the left raider is in action, the right corner is in prime position to initiate any attack and vice versa.

Centre player plays in centre position. The raider of the team mostly stands in the centre position.

The ins are positioned between the corners and the covers. One of the major responsibilities of the ‘in’ is to protect the corner defender from going into the lobby or out of the court. The ins are generally the raiders of the team and also help in defense such as catching the raider.

The defenders positioned between the ins and centre are known as the covers. Generally, the teams position their all-rounders in this position.

Yoga is an ancient practice designed to harmonise the body and mind. This unit will introduce and guide you through yoga for holistic development, emphasising the practical application of the eight limbs of yoga to achieve both physical health and mental well-being. We will explore how consistent yoga practice can foster self-awareness, discipline and ethical conduct, ultimately empowering students to become more responsible and compassionate individuals.


## About Yoga

In the Grade 6, we learnt that the word ‘Yoga’ is derived from the Sanskrit root ‘Yuj’, meaning ‘to join’ or ‘to unite’ or 'to integrate.’ It is the union of body, mind and the inner self. Yoga brings balance, harmony and a sense of oneness within us and the world around us.

Yoga helps us to grow in many ways physically, mentally, emotionally and socially. Practising yoga regularly builds a stronger body, acalmer mind and more balanced emotions. This inner harmony helps us become better students, loyal friends, responsible family members, and citizens of the nation. It is necessary to maintain a consistent Yoga practice to handle life's challenges with balance and focus.

Each section in this unit will enhance your understanding and practice of yoga. We will start with an introduction to yoga for holistic Development. Then learn about Yama, Niyama and their applications in our daily lives; Sukshma Vyayama (joint movements), Sithalikarana vyayama (dynamic practices), Surya Namaskara, Asana (postures), relaxation, Mudras, Kriyas, Pranayama (regulation of breath), Pratyahara (mastery over senses), Dharana (concentration,) Dhyana (meditation) and Krida Yoga (Yoga games).


## Yoga Session Structure

Begin your yoga session with the prayer given on next page. Through this prayer, we honour the bond between students and teachers. Together, they ask for divine guidance, protection and wisdom. They also wish for peace for everyone, everywhere.

General instructions to begin and end a Yoga session


## ¢ Sit comfortably in Sukhdsana with your spine, neck and head straight.

Close your eyes, relax your face and bring your awareness to your breath.

¢ Place your hands in Chin Mudra. Observe your breath for a few moments. Then, take a deep and slow breath. As you exhale, gently chant “Om.”

Gently place your hands in Namaskara Mudra and chant prayer given in the following page.

Notice how you feel after chanting Om.

¢ Gently rub your palms together, place them over your closed eyes and then slowly open your eyes to the warmth of your hands.

## Chapter 1


## Yoga for Daily Life

In this chapter, we will explore different ways to integrate yoga into our daily routines. To incorporate yoga into our daily routine, it is necessary to practice ‘Yoga in action’ (Karma Yoga), as taught by Shri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. The Bhagavad Gita defines yoga as ‘Yogah Karmasu Kausalam (2.50),’ which means ‘Yoga is skill in action.’ This means doing our tasks ina relaxed and focused way to get the best results.

Think about a Kho-Kho player. They are not just running fast; they are also incredibly calm and focused, even when the game gets intense. That is a lesson for all of us. Whether we are studying, playing a sport, or learning a new skill, it is not just about working hard and stressing out. It is about staying calm, focusing our attention and truly enjoying the process.

Sri Aurobindo highlights that yoga is about overall personality development at the physical, mental, intellectual, emotional and spiritual levels. It is about growing in all areas of life.

Imagine a big tree. For it to be strong and healthy, all its parts—roots, trunk, branches and leaves—must grow together. Similar to this, we must grow in all facts of life to achieve balance and strength.

How can we grow in different aspects and achieve holistic development?

Yoga helps us understand the connection between our body, mind, and inner self. Similarly, in Pancha Kosha (44 lS)

ee ee cect Yoga 1 57

explained in the Taittiriya Upanishad, talks about the five layers of our existence, much like the layers of an onion. These layers are body, energy, mind, wisdom and bliss. Various Yoga techniques help nurture each of these layers, enhancing our overall well-being.

Let us understand each Kosha and its role in holistic development. The Pancha Kosha framework helps us understand ourselves better. It gives us insight into both our inner and outer worlds, helping us become more self-aware, empathetic and purposeful.


## ry ANNAMAYA KOsHA. (Physical Sheath)


## PRANAMAYA KOSHA (Energy Sheath)


## MANoMAya KosSHA


## (Mind Sheath) VIJNANAMAYA KOSHA (Wisdom sheath)


## ANANDAMAYA KOSHA (Bliss Sheath)

1. Annamaya Kosha (Physical Sheath)

This is the outermost layer, which is our physical body—the part we can see, touch and feel. It's made from the food we eat. Playing sports, running, eating healthy food, occasional fasting, living with nature and sleeping well are the ways to make us healthy. Yoga postures help strengthen and balance our physical body. Just like a plant needs water and

sunlight to grow, our body needs food, exercise

and rest to stay healthy.


## Physciall Education


## Pranamaya Kosha (Energy Sheath)

Our bodies have layers, and the one just under our skin is called the Pranamaya Kosha. This layer is powered by ‘Prana,’ our life energy, which we get from breathing. Prana is like invisible rivers inside us, helping our lungs, heart and everything else work together. Breathing connects us to the air and the earth, giving us energy. We can strengthen our Prana with special exercises like Pranayama, Mudra, and Kriyd, helping us feel strong and healthy.


## Manomaya Kosha (Mind Sheath)

This layer is about our thoughts, feelings and perceptions. It is where our emotions and desires come from. It includes what we think, how we feel, and how we react to things. Activities like meditation, mantra chanting (japa), listening to music, singing, painting, and Trataka (focusing on a point) help refine this layer. A calm mind helps you solve problems, stay focused on tasks, and handle challenges easily. When you feel happy or sad, it’s your Manomaya Kosha experiencing those emotions.


## Vijnanamaya Kosha (Wisdom Sheath)

This layer helps us distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad. It is responsible for decision-making, knowledge, wisdom and understanding. Wisdom from this sheath helps us make the right choices, making us better students, friends, family members and responsible citizens of the nation. It also helps us understand our strengths and weaknesses and discover our life’s purpose. When we learn something new at school or figure out what’s right and wrong, it is our Vijnanamaya Kosha at work. Think of it as the map that helps


## us navigate life. lees

5. Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss Sheath)

This is the innermost layer and the source of pure joy or bliss. Think about how peaceful and happy you feel when playing with your pet, sitting quietly in nature, pursuing your hobbies, singing and listening to songs, helping others, or contributing to society. That deep sense of contentment f and joy comes from the Anandamaya Kosha. Understanding the five koshas shows us how interconnected we are. Yoga is a tool to nurture and balance all these sheath.

## FIVE NIYAMAS


## Sauhca: Cleanliness

Santosha: Being happy and content with what we have. Tapas: Self-discipline and determination to achieve. Swadhyaya: Self-study.

Ishwara Pranidhana: recognising the divinity.

In this grade, let us learn about Ishwara Pranidhana. one of the Niyamas, It is about recognising the divinity within our self and surrendering to it.

Ishwara Pranidhana is also about seeing our body as a temple and offering everything we do to the divine within us. Our senses, actions, breath, and even our happiness are all part of this offering. It’s about recognising the sacredness inside and around us and being grateful to it.


## Divinity in all

We usually think place of worship and prayer rooms are sacred.

But yoga teaches us that everything is sacred. Pranidhana means seeing the divine in everything — nature, friends, family and even

daily work. The story below gives us the message of finding divinity in all.


## A Journey of Oneness

Guru Nanak was a great spiritual teacher who believed that

God is everywhere. One day, he was on a pilgrimage to a holy

city. Tired from the journey, he laid down to rest. A devotee : saw Guru Nanak and was concerned.

“Your feet are pointing towards our holy place of worship,” he said. “It’s disrespectful.” Guru Nanak, politely asked the devotee to place his feet where there is no holy place.

But no matter which way the devotee moved Nanak’s feet, he still saw the place of worship in front of them. Then devotee recognized divinity of Guru Nanak and apologised to him.

This story shows us that for Guru Nanak, every place was divine. He believed that God is present in all directions, places and in all creations.


## ACTIVITY

Different communities have different beliefs and traditions. Give some examples of how people perform rituals and explain the reasons behind their actions. For example, harvest festivals are celebrated to thank the Earth for food. It shows that Earth is alive and deserves our respect.


## Note for the teacher

Encourage the students to take a walk in nature. Let them notice the pretty things around them and understand how everything works together. For “ al at example a tree with birds and small animals on it.

Students can keep a gratitude journal. Let them list five or more things they are grateful for everyday.

## Pranayama

In this grade let us learn more about breathing through the fourth aspect of Ashtanga Yoga which is Pranayama.

Pranayama is the practice of controlling our breath. In Yoga, our breath is considered a powerful tool. Breathing techniques that promote our life force are Pranayama. The word Pranayama comes from two words: ‘Prana’ means ‘vital energy’ and ‘Yama’ means ‘to control or extend’. So, Pranayama is the way by which we consciously control and direct our breath to make ourselves happier and healthier.

Why is Pranayama Important for students?

Just like we need healthy food to stay physically fit, likewise to keep the body energised and calm the mind, we need to do Pranayama practices. It’s especially helpful for students because it helps with focus during studies, staying calm during exams, and even feeling more energised for sports or daily activities.

balances the flow of Prana (life force) and cleans the subtle energy channels.

3. Bhramarit Pranayama

Bhramart Pranayama is a calming technique, which has a soothing effect on the mind and nervous system.

(Refer to Khel Yatra Grade 6 textbook for the above practices).

Let us learn how to perform Bhramari Pranayama by adopting Shanmukhi Mudra:

Shanmukhi means six gates or faces. Shanmukhi mudra_ involves redirecting the awareness inside by closing the six doors of outer perception, the two eyes, the two ears, the nose and the mouth. This practice promotes a state of Pratyahara. In other words, it closes the six gates of perception in the head with the fingers of both hands.


## Physcial Education 7 - Unit 6.indd 197

¢ Sit in Sukhdsana with the spine erect, face smiling and eyes gently closed.

¢ Nowraise both the arms to shoulder level, bend your elbows and close the ears with the thumb.

e Place the index finger gently on the eyelids, middle finger on both the nostrils and ring and small finger above and below the lips as shown in the picture.

e Inhale slowly and deeply and fill the lungs completely.

e As you exhale, make a steady, low-pitched humming sound like a bee. (Makara sound from Omkara chanting)

¢ Feel the vibration of the sound resonate throughout your head and body. Repeat the practice five times.


## BENEFITS OF SHANMUKHI MUDRA

¢ Shanmukhi Mudra calms the mind and nervous system. * It also balances internal and external awareness.

¢ It also enhances focus and helps in managing anxiety. Note for the teacher

« Ask the students whether they could feel the resonance during the practice. * Ask about their state of mind after the practice.

In this grade let us learn about Bhastrika Pranayama stepwise.


## Bhastrika Pranayama

Bhastrika is a special breathing exercise that gets its name from ‘bellows’, because it's like breathing in and out like a bellows. You can do it slowly or quickly, whichever feels comfortable.

During Bhastrika, you breathe deeply and fully, so your body gets lots of oxygen. You use your chest like a bellows to breathe in and out strongly.


## Khel Yatra

There are two parts to Bhastrika — the first part is like a cleansing breath, and the second part is slower and calmer. That’s why Bhastrika is sometimes called a bridge between cleansing breaths and calmer breathing exercises.


## Stepwise practice of Bhastrika Pranayama

Step 1: It ina comfortable posture Sukhasana or Vajrasana. Keep the head and spine i) straight, and close the eyes and relax the whole body.

Step 2: Take a deep breath through both nostrils and fill the lungs with air.

Step 3: After full inhalation, quickly exhale continuously for 5 times. This completes one round of Bhastrika.

Step 4: Continue this practice for 3 rounds.


## SE BENEFITS

¢ Bhastrika Pranayama strengthens the lungs and improves blood circulation.

¢ It relaxes the body and mind and improves concentration.

‘Limitations: The students with the low stamina should avoid this: practice. \

Note for the teacher ¢ Ensure the students gently practice this Pranayama without any jerks.

## MUDRAS INTRODUCTION TO HAND MUDRAS

Let us explore hand mudras! Have you ever seen pictures of saints or gods with their hands in special positions? These are called hand mudras.

Mudras are hand gestures that help connect our body, mind and energy. The word ‘mudra’ means ‘gesture’ or ‘seal’ in Sanskrit. They are like special hand signals that can help our energy flow freely.

People have been using mudras for a very long

time to feel better physically and mentally.

In this grade let us learn about Jnana mudra.

Jnana Mudra is an important and simple mudra which calms the mind.


## STEPWISE PRACTICE OF JNANA MUDRA

1. Sit in a comfortable posture Sukhasana or Vajrasana or on a chair with the back straight.

Place your hands on thighs with your palm facing upward.

Now gently touch the tip of the thumb with the tip of the index finger. Do not press hard.

4. Stretch the other finger straight, let the palm be facing upward.

5. Keep the focus on your breath.

6. Practice it for 10 minutes every day.


## BENEFITS

¢ Jnana Mudra reduces mental tension, anger and stress. * It increases memory power.

¢ It gives energy to the brain and muscles.


## Khel Yatra

We also learnt Shanmukhi Mudra with Bhramart Pranayama in the previous chapter.

Note for the teacher * Encourage students to practice this mudras everyday especially before studies.


## Pratyahara

Hello students, Have you heard of Pratyahara?

Pratyahara is a special tool which helps us to focus. It is a cool way to develop our concentration and remain calm.

Pratyahara is the 5th step of Ashtanga Yoga, which teaches us how to concentrate deeper and stronger.

So, in this grade let us learn how to reduce distraction by doing the below activity.

Activity to develop focus by engaging your ear to the sound


## of a bell

Let us listen to the sound of a temple bell. Listen closely as it starts with a strong ‘bong!’ and then continues to ring. Notice how the ringing changes — it might be loud at first and then become softer and softer until it finally disappears. Try to feel the vibrations of the sound within you.


## Physcial Education 7 - Unit 6.indd 201


## Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi

Dharana means single point concentration and involves keeping the mind study and focus.

Dharana is like learning to use a focus for your mind. It is about training your mind to pay attention to just one thing, like focusing sunlight with a magnifying glass.

better, concentrate on tasks and mangae your


## wT

When your mind is focused, it helps you study b

thoughts. You can practice Dharana by choosing something to focus on, like your breath or a word, and trying to keep your mind from wandering. This skill, along with Dhyana, helps you find inner peace and is an important part of Yoga.

In the previous grade, we learnt about jatru trataka, which improves our focus. Let us continue the practice in this grade.

Let us practice Dharana by focusing on a single point. Jatru Trataka is yogic gazing that helps to bring one pointed concentration or focus. It is a practice where the gaze is fixed on an object or the target. Before starting it is a good idea to cleanse your eyes with cold water.

Wash your hands with soap thoroughly. Make a cup of your right palm and fill it with clean water. Now, immerse your right eyeball in this water. Blink the eyes for few rounds. Repeat the same practice with the left eye.

## jJatru trataka

Step 1: Sit in Vajrasana or Sukhadsana comfortably. Keep your eyes open and hands on the thighs.

Step 2: Now stretch both the hands in front, make fists out of them while the thumbs raised upwards.

Step 3: Move both the hands towards both the shoulders parallel to the ground and keep gazing at the tip of the thumbs. Stretch the hands sideways as far as possible until the reach of the vision.

Step 4: Maintain this position for a while by holding the hands at both the ends. Slowly move the hands back to the original position while gazing at the tip of the thumbs. Do not move the head but move only the eyeballs sideways.


## Repeat this practice for 3-5 rounds.

Step 5: After the practice do simple palming and relax in Vajrasana or Sukhasana.


## Yoga 203


## Simple palming procedure

¢ Rub both palms until they become warm.

¢ Cup your palms and place them gently over the eyes (do not put pressure on the eyeballs).

¢ Keep your eyes closed.

¢ Keep your palms on your eyes for 10-15 seconds, then gently lift them.

Sideways viewing of Jatru trataka relaxes the muscles around the eyes.

« It also prevents and corrects squint. « It also improves eyesight, vision and concentration.

‘Limitations: Students with severe headaches should avoid this. practice.


## Note for the teacher

Ensure that students remove their glasses and wrist watches.

Encourage them to sit with the head, neck and spine erect during the practice. * Always open your eyes with a few blinks.

Ensure palming is done after each practice.

For up and down and right and left movement of the Jatru trataka refer to the Khel Yatra Grade 6 textbook.


## Khel Yatra

## DHYANA

Dhyana means meditation. When we focus really hard on one thing (this is called Dharana), our mind starts to calm down. This calmness and stillness is Dhyana.

Dhyana helps us feel peaceful inside, even when things around us are noisy or chaotic. Imagine training your mind to focus on one thing like a laser beam that’s Dharana.

Both Dharana and Dhyana can help you focus better in school, stay calm during exams, and feel more peaceful in your everyday life.


## Activity Simple Meditation Exercise

Now let us learn simple meditation technique step by step.

¢ Sit in a comfortable posture Sukhdsana or Vajrasana with spine erect and eyes closed.

Now slowly move your awareness on your breath. Observe your breathing for a few seconds as you breathe in and breath out.

¢ If thoughts come into your mind, don’t worry. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath.

Practice this for a few minutes. This is Dhyana, where you focus on your breath and let your mind become calm and peaceful.


## PANCHAKOSHA MEDITATION

Just like a house has different rooms like the living room, kitchen, and bedroom, our bodies also have different layers. We learned about these layers in Chapter 1.

In this grade, let's go on an inner journey to explore these layers

within ourselves through meditation. This inner journey will help us understand ourselves better and feel more peaceful and happy.


## Step-by-step practice of Panchakosha meditation

1. Sit comfortably in Sukhasana with the head, neck and spine in a straight line. Keep the body relaxed.

2. Now gently close your eyes, become aware of your surroundings and sounds around you. Begin by gently scanning your body, be aware of your head, shoulders, chest, waist, back, abdomen, arms and legs notice any sensation or any areas of tension. Acknowledge these sensations without judgement. This is your Annamaya kosha, the physical body. Observe it for a few seconds and relax the physical body.

3. Now shift your focus to your breath. Bring your awareness between your nostrils and observe the air entering the nostrils as you breathe in and breathe out. Observe your breathing slows down andis more continuous and rhythmic. Be aware of the breath as your lungs expands and contracts. This is your Pranamaya kosha. Observe for a few seconds and enjoy the lightness of the body.

4. Now observe the thoughts that arise in your mind. Notice how they come and go like clouds in the sky. Simply acknowledge them and gently bring your attention back to your breath. Now shift your awareness and become aware of the sensation in your body. You might start feeling uncomfortable sitting in one position for a long time and want to move your legs or you might experience some kind of itching sensation on your skin, nose, etc., This is a reflexive mental chatter that comes from your mind. This is your Manomaya Kosha.

5. Trynottorespond to it, but continue to observe your breath. Connect with your inner wisdom and ask yourself


## Khel Yatra

“What brings me joy”. Gently listen to the inner guidance that arises. This is your Vijinanamaya Kosha.

6. Now shift your awareness deep in sight. Now centre your awareness to your heart, relax deeply, Keep breathing smoothly and evenly. Now allow yourself to settle in a state of complete tranquility. Enjoy the sense of great joy and gratitude within you. It is a space of perfect stillness, silence and happiness. There is no fear or desire. This is your Anandamaya Kosha. Now simply be aware of your own awareness.

7. Return your awareness to your breath, become aware of your surroundings. Observe that your breathing is slow and continuous. Take a moment to relax and absorb this experience before you get up.

8. Now gently rub your palms, place it on your eyes and open your eyes into your palms.

¢ Panchakosha meditation calms the mind and reduces stress. ¢ It improves focus and self-awareness. ¢ It brings peace and happiness.

Note for the teacher ¢ Encourage students to share their experiences with meditation.

¢ Let students focus on breath, observe their thoughts and feelings during the practice.


## Physcial Education 7 - Unit 6.indd 207


## SAMADHI

Samadhi is the ultimate state of consciousness. It is a transcending thought. You are only aware of yourself and are connected to your true nature love, joy and strength. This is the ultimate goal that we seek to achieve in life.


## Krida Yoga

Yoga is a process for all round personality development. Krida yoga plays an important part in this process. Krida yoga means yoga through games. It is a fun and active way to practise yoga through different kinds ofplayful activities. Krida yoga combines yoga movements with games to help you build flexibility, strength and focus while having fun with your classmates.

These games are easy to learn and play and ensure total participation. These games not only give us an insight into our state of awareness but also help us to develop it.

Here are a few games which you can play with your friends in the class or with members of your family.


## Yoga of Reflection

Yoga of reflection is an indoor game, normally played in groups. This game develops focus and mindfulness by copying the movements of the opponents. This game also improves concentration, body awareness and coordination.

How TO PLAY 1. Divide the class into two groups,

2. Let the students pair up and face each other.
