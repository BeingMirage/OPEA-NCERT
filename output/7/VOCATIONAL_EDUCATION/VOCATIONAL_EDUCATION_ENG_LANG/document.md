## FOREWORD

The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pafichakoshas, in the foundational and the preparatory stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the middle stage. Thus, the middle stage acts as a bridge between the preparatory and the secondary stages, spanning three years from Grades 6 to 8.

The NCF-SE 2023, at the middle stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages, including at least two languages native to India, science, mathematics, social sciences, art education, physical education and well-being, and vocational education, promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks.

## 00_Prelims.indd 4

Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 7, is one of these. Its content comprises projects related to three work forms—life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

## ABOUT THE BOOK

Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 7 is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023.

In the National Curriculum Framework 2023 (NCF-SE 2023), work has been categorised under three broad forms: work with life forms, work with machines and materials, and work in human services. The intent at this stage is to provide vocational exposure to the students through a wide range of activities categorised into three forms of work. To achieve this, students are expected to take up nine projects across Grades 6 to 8, i.e., three projects in each grade and one from each form of work.

Curricular goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the activity book. The following Curricular Goals (CG) given in the activity book cover a range of competencies.

CG-1: Develops in-depth basic skills and allied knowledge of work and their associated materials or procedures;

CG-2: Understands the place and usefulness of vocational skills and vocations in the world of work;

CG-3: Develops essential values while working across areas; and

CG-4: Develops basic skills and allied knowledge to run and contribute to a home.

The activity book contains six illustrative projects, two for each form of work, intended to cover the above curricular goals. The choice of projects is left entirely to schools. One project may be taken up by students or preferably, the school can design other projects based on local considerations. The NCF-SE 2023, and indeed this activity book, encourages schools to select projects based on local considerations and availability of resources. Annexure 1 provides a template for designing a project other than those in the book.

The illustrative projects are as follows:

Project 1 is on developing a Plant Nursery. Students will engage in creating and maintaining a plant nursery on school grounds or in pots.

18-03-2025 4.53.37 PM.


## 00_Prelims.indd 6

They will learn about the various agricultural practices through field visits and hands-on learning, with a focus on the conditions essential for the propagation of plants.

Project 2 is on developing a School Habitat Garden. Students will study a variety of life within the school premises or nearby areas and learn about the needs of different groups of animals. They will design a garden, including non-plant elements, to meet these needs. This project will enhance their observational skills, knowledge of biodiversity, and the significance of conservation. It will also instill a sense of environmental stewardship and the importance of protecting natural habitats.

Project 3 is on Tie and Dye. In this project, students will explore various techniques used for tie and dye. They will learn to use tools and materials to create functional or artistic items, fostering creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. This project will encourage innovation and creative thinking, preparing students for potential careers in design and fashion.

Project 4 is on developing an AI Assistant. It will introduce students to the fundamentals of machine learning. They will learn to train a machine to identify data related to their surroundings. This project will enhance their technological proficiency, creativity, and logical thinking.

Project 5 is on Puppetry. Storytime with Puppets project will help students develop the skills of writing a script, making puppets and putting up a show to narrate a story of their choice or to develop awareness. This project will cultivate an appreciation for heritage, enhance organisational skills, and promote teamwork. It will also provide a platform for students to express their creativity.

Project 6 is on developing a Family Health Handbook. In this project, students will reflect on the components of physical health and mental well-being. They will learn about the needs of people of different age groups. This project will teach them how to respond in case of ill health, the importance of healthy eating, and the importance of physical activity and social interaction.

As the culmination of the work done through the year related to vocational education, a Kaushal Mela will be organised by the school at the end of the year to showcase the products students have created and

## 00_Prelims.indd 7

the services they have learnt. It will also be an opportunity for students to share their experiences and learnings. Community members and key functionaries may be invited to the Kaushal Mela.

Finally, annexures include a planning template, competencies and learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 7, suggestive projects in each of the forms of work in some detail, and time required for each of the illustrative projects.

Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated into all the projects. Reflective and thought-provoking questions included under different activities are engaging and they promote joyful learning along with assessment. Students are provided opportunities to do different things, record small successes, take and give feedback, work with peers, try and re-try tasks, answer questions, reflect, and experience the values related to work. Illustrations have been designed depicting the context and processes to enhance learning. In-text questions are also included to assess comprehension of the idea or the subject. At the end of the project, questions given in ‘Think and Answer’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, and analysing.

Students can access the additional resources provided in the Quick Response (QR) code for each project.

We sincerely hope that students will enjoy doing these projects and they will help develop the desired and intended competencies.

## NOTE FOR SCHOOL HEADS AND TEACHERS

Teachers are pivotal to achieving the goals set out in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 introduces vocational education as a distinct subject starting in Grade 6. The purpose of this subject is to promote ‘learning by doing’, ‘dignity of labour’, and the development of vocational capacities through exposure to a wide range of work. Successful implementation will aid in developing responsible and confident adults who value all professions. Vocational education in schools also offers a robust medium for holistic learning by offering students opportunities to apply conceptual learning in other curricular areas to real-life situations.

In Grade 7, students will take up one project in each of the ‘Forms of Work’. The sequence of these projects is not important, so long as all the projects are completed within the academic year. These projects can be taken up at the same time or one after the other. Groups of students may also take up different projects, which depends on the nature of the project and other factors, such as the number of students, resources available, and so on. Please note that it is important to identify concepts across curricular areas that students need to know (e.g., seed germination for projects on Life Forms) and ensure that they have been covered before starting the project.

In this activity book, the projects are designed as per the Learning Outcomes for Vocational Education in Grade 7. The focus is on the following:

1. Using physical tools/equipment for carrying out different processes to perform authentic tasks.

2. Gaining clarity about what is to be done and reaching the final outcome through breaking down a task into smaller activities that are easier to complete.

3. Understanding how to prepare materials and use tools and equipment, while following safety measures and protocols. Connecting the activities done in school to the world of work. Assessing work done in terms of quantity and quality.

Applying what is learnt in school to daily life. Working collaboratively in groups while ensuring individual participation in each activity.


## Nous

18-03-2025 4.53.37 PM.


## 00_Prelims.indd 11

In doing so, students will be able to develop values related to work, particularly respect for all work. They will realise the importance of the dignity of labour, which means that no work is considered superior and therefore, no work or person should be discriminated against on any basis.

The projects in the Activity Book are illustrative. Schools can choose to take up any one or design their own from each form of work.

Annexure 1 provides guidelines for designing a project in alignment with curricular goals, competencies and learning outcomes.

Annexure 3 has details of five additional projects in each form of work.

Thus, for each form of work, schools may (i) select one project from each form of work; (ii) design their own projects; (iii) further detail out any one of the additional projects given in the Activity Book.


## Pedagogy and Assessment

Projects comprise a set of activities that are generally expected to be completed in a group or individually, as required. Resources for projects (e.g., tools, equipment, materials, use of workspaces, etc.) and resource persons or master instructors (e.g., mechanics, farmers, craftspersons, artisans, persons working in technology, and experts in the field) must be drawn from the community. Exposure visits and interactions with professionals are built into the project to enable students to observe and understand work in real settings.

The total time allotted to vocational education is 110 hours or 165 periods in one academic year, excluding time for assessment, school events, bagless days and similar activities (Section 4.3 of the NCF-SE 2023). These periods may be distributed across the week as two blocks of two periods on week-days and one period on Saturday.

Each project is expected to be completed in about 30 hours (approximately 55 periods of 40 minutes each). This duration is to ensure a long-term engagement that allows students to complete a set of interrelated activities. It also gives them time for trial and error, to try out things differently, and to extend their learning into other activities.

The focus of the projects must be creativity and demonstration of skills, and the process of ‘doing’ rather than just the ‘product’ or


## xi

18-03-2025 4.53.37 PM.


## 00_Prelims.indd 12

outcome. Working in groups and observing people with expertise is important to foster an appreciation for teamwork, creativity, sensitivity, persistence, and other important values related to work.

Students must be active throughout, as they take up activities that are directly connected to real life and the world of work. They must be able to integrate learning from other curricular areas into the projects. Prevalent biases must be addressed, for example, by not assigning specific work roles to a particular gender or to students from a specific social group. All students must participate in the activities. To ensure the participation of students with disabilities, projects can be adapted or an entirely different project may be developed.

The activity book is designed to enable continuous assessment by teachers, as well as self and peer-assessment by students. The questions and formats for recording require students to assess their own progress, share their learning and reflections, and record their answers as they move from one activity to the next.

Students must also maintain a portfolio in order to help them see their own progress, and record the processes and products related to the projects. It may contain any work done by students, including additional notes, presentations, sketches or photographs (besides those in the activity book) related to the project, and products they have created.

Assessing the inculcation of values related to work (e.g., initiative, persistence and focus, responsibility, discipline, eye for detail, curiosity and creativity, empathy and sensitivity, and willingness to do physical work) is particularly important. Students must be observed while at work to assess the same. Checklists and rubrics that outline specific behaviours and attitudes related to work values may be developed by the teachers. Annexure 2 contains the competencies to be developed across the middle stage and the learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 7.

While this is true for all subjects, the role of feedback is particularly important in vocational education. Students must be encouraged and motivated by recognition of their work and their creativity. This approach ensures that all students are able to complete their work successfully through ongoing guidance, which in turn is motivating.


## xii

## 00_Prelims.indd 13

Summative assessment for Grade 7 can, for example, comprise a viva voce, presentation, role play, simulation, group discussion, presentations, and the review of students’ responses to prompts or questions in the activity book. The paper pencil test, could include situational questions, concept maps, flowcharts, questions related to learning from visits, and multiple-choice questions. Each project also has a set of questions in the last section. These questions address key aspects of learning and concepts that are strengthened while doing the activities. To reiterate, the focus must be on assessing capacities and understanding of processes.

A suggested weightage and marking scheme for assessment and evaluation is given below:

Mode of Assessment Weightage Written Test 10% Oral Presentation/Viva Voce 30% Activity Book 30% Portfolio 10% Teachers’ Observations during Activities 20%


## Criteria for Project Selection

The activity book is meant for students, and therefore speaks to them. There are various components in each project, as indicated by the headings of sections (please refer to Annexure 1). These components are aligned with the competencies defined for vocational education in the NCF-SE 2023 (please refer to Annexure 2). Therefore, any project other than those in the activity book must include the same components. Examples of additional projects are given in Annexure 3.

The projects in this activity book are not mandatory, therefore schools are free to choose any one of these from each form of work or design an entirely different project. Students must also be encouraged to come up with ideas for projects.

If you and the students decide to choose a project other than those in the activity book, the following must be kept in mind for all the forms of work:


## xiii

18-03-2025 4.53.37 PM.


## 00_Prelims.indd 14

Is the project appropriate for students in Grade 7? Does the project help students use learning from other subjects? Is the project related to the work the students see around them? Will the students be able to interact with persons who are experts in the work related to the project? Will the students be able to get hands-on experience? 6. Will students be able to take up different kinds of activities within the project? 7. Will students find the activities within the project challenging and interesting? 8. Will students learn something they can use at home? 9. Willit develop the values related to work, particularly the dignity of labour?

10. Will the project help students acquire vocational capacities for their daily living (e.g., using technology, consciousness of environmental concerns and sustainability, taking care of oneself, doing small tasks at home, and the likes)?

The proposed time allocation and connection of each section of the project to the learning outcomes for Grade 7 are given in Annexure 4. This may be referred to while developing a project other than those in the activity book. You must develop the project for a duration of about 30 hours (approximately 55 periods of 40 minutes each).

Please note that suggestions for the use of technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, are placed in boxes throughout the activity book. Suggestions for Internet search are also included. Due precautions must be taken to ensure the safety of students. The use of the Internet by the students must be supervised, and they must work in groups.


## PwWn Pe

Who will teach?

Since the purpose of vocational education in the middle stage is to provide vocational exposure to students, and till such time that teacher education programmes offer specialisation in vocational education, existing teachers will take up the subject in the middle stage, with the support of resource persons/master instructors. In the absence


## xiv

18-03-2025 4.53.38 PM.


## 00_Prelims.indd 15

of a vocational teacher, a teacher of any subject can take the lead in organising activities for projects in which they have some understanding and expertise.

The Head of the School may nominate a “Teacher Coordinator” among the existing teachers to coordinate and schedule the activities of different projects to be undertaken at the Middle Stage.


## Safety Measures

Due care must be taken to ensure safety at all times. Safety measures must be demonstrated to students, who, in turn will also demonstrate their understanding of how to keep themselves and others safe. Where necessary, use of certain tools and materials by students may be supervised in small groups. Due safety during field visits, ranging from transportation to orientation of resource persons must receive necessary attention.

NOTE FOR STUDENTS Dear Students,

This activity book will help you learn about different kinds of work and how to do work yourself.

When you think about work, you must remember two things: (i) all work is important, and (ii) people work not only to make a living, but also to make life more joyful and interesting. In daily life, you see people doing various kinds of work. Some of the work is related to running a household while some is related to earning a living.

Vocational education prepares you to deal with practical things related to daily life and understand the world of work. The projects that you will do in school will give you an opportunity to work with your hands, work in groups with your peers, and learn the skills which help you become self-dependent in life.

How to use the Activity Book?

Read through the introduction of the project to get an idea of what you will be doing.

Materials Needed Gather all the materials listed at the beginning of each activity Follow the Steps

1. Each activity has clear, numbered steps. Follow them to complete each task. Take your time and make sure you understand each step before moving on. Take notes during field visits or interaction with experts.

2. Complete all the questions and tables given in the activity book, which will help you to both learn and check your understanding.


## Check Your Work

After completion of the task, reflect on what you have learnt and what else you want to learn. Questions have been included to help you both think and write about what you are doing. Write in your own words, use simple language, and share your observations and thoughts. After

18-03-2025 4.53.38 PM.


## 00_Prelims.indd 17

finishing an activity, review your work. Make sure you have completed all the steps and answered the questions.

If the space in the activity book is not enough, please use a different notebook or loose sheets, which you can add to the portfolio.


## Ask for Help

If you are unsure about any part of an activity, do not hesitate to ask the teacher, parent, or peer for help. Ask as many questions as needed if something is unclear. Collaboration and discussion can make learning fun and effective.

You can also get help from internet searches or using AI tools. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence and AI tools make our tasks easy by helping us find things or do something quickly. Please note that AI is not necessary for your projects; you can use it if you want.


## Take Breaks

Do not rush through the activities. If you start feeling tired, take a short break.


## Be Creative

Some activities may have open-ended questions or ask for your creative inputs. Let your imagination flow.


## Stay Positive

Learning new things can be challenging. Stay positive and remember that practice makes you perfect.


## Reflect

Think about what you have learned from each activity. Share your progress with peers and teachers and ask for their feedback.

Design Your Projects Think about how you can continue to build on your learning to do other things.

Try out different things, other than those in the activity book. There may be a new way of doing something or maybe different materials


## xvii

18-03-2025 4.53.38 PM.


## 00_Prelims.indd 18

can be used. If you face any difficulty or want to try out something different, reach out to others or consult library books. But do remember to discuss this with your group and the teacher. You may want to work beyond school hours and do some of the activities at home. You can even help your family and friends with what you learnt.

If you have any ideas for projects other than the ones suggested here, you can share them with your teacher, who will help you design your project.


## Internet Safety

If you use Internet searches or AI tools or both, please do so under supervision of an adult. You need to be careful of what you are accessing on the Internet. Just as there are places in and around your school and home where you will not go without an adult, there are places on the Internet that are not safe for anyone, neither you, nor adults. You must take care, and whenever in doubt, ask someone you trust.

## Work with Life Forms


## Ch-1 Plant Nursery.indd 2

‘Life forms’ include all living things on earth. They include human beings, mammals, birds, fish, plants, insects, reptiles and even bacteria and viruses. Projects on Work with Life Forms will help you work with living things in different ways. You can take up projects related to growing plants in various ways, recording the biodiversity around you, surveying medicinal plants, learning to care for domestic animals, and maintaining a nature journal. It is up to you to imagine all that you can do in the activities with your peers.

Two examples of projects are given in this section, which are Plant Nursery and School Habitat Garden. You must take up only one project. You can either choose one of these projects or you can design a project of your own choice with the help of your teacher.

Plants propagate, that is, they reproduce themselves, through various methods. Tiny seeds germinate and grow into a huge tree or a small flowering plant. However, some plants can be grown directly from the branches of the mother plant or tubers (e.g. potatoes).

Like humans, plants require a suitable environment to survive and grow. In science, you have learned that plants need air, sunlight, nutrients, and water for their growth. These factors are essential, but beyond them, plants also need a favourable environment to thrive, just like we do.

Let us understand this with an example. Do you live in a warm and humid region, a cold and dry region, or a place that experiences different seasons? If you reside in a cold and dry area, you might have heard people say, “It is so dry”, the dryness can cause itchy skin and burning sensation in the nostrils. That is why, when using a heater or bukhari, people often place a bowl of water in the room to add moisture to the air.

But what causes humidity or dryness? As you have studied, air contains various components, including water vapour. When there is a high amount of water vapour in the air, the weather feels humid, whereas a lower amount makes the air dry.

Just like too much or too little humidity affects us, it also impacts plants, especially during their growth stages. Similarly, extreme temperatures can be uncomfortable for humans, and plants also require an “optimal temperature” to grow. However, the ideal temperature varies among plants, which is why some plants flourish only in specific seasons.

Have you observed that more plants grow near a water stream, on the edges of ponds or near water sources (e.g., wells, water-tap) than in dry places? This is because they get optimum temperature, humidity, and moisture in the soil.

In the plant nursery (Figure 1.1) you will need to create these conditions for optimum survival and growth of plants.

Thimmamma Marimanu, a banyan tree located in Ananthapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh, is spread over 5 acres. This is the size of a small village.

Imagine! A tree spread so far that it could house an entire village under its branches. Isn’t it fascinating that a single seed has grown into such a big tree? The banyan tree provides shade, oxygen and shelter to birds, animals and humans. It teaches

Plant nurseries are important for various reasons, e.g., preserving original plant species, and creating new varieties of plants, and producing plants ona very large scale. Since nurseries are developed in a smaller space compared to farms, it is easier to prevent pests and provide protection from unsuitable conditions like heavy rain or severe heat.

Since conditions for healthy growth of plants can be created in plant nurseries, plants can be grown whenever required and not only during the seasons that are generally suitable for them. People visit plant nurseries to buy plants for their homes, gardens and agriculture field.

At the end of project, you will be able to:

cutters and knives must be used carefully. You need to take necessary care to ensure your safety and of others too.

3. Use gloves that fit well so you have a good grip on tools and equipment.

4. Always ask for help if you are unsure about how to use a tool.

5. Wash hands carefully after working with soil as it may contain many disease-causing micro-organisms.

6. Use proper lifting techniques— bend your knees not your back while lifting heavy weight.

7. Hang tools on racks or place them in marked places or storage boxes.

ea Internet safety: Ask your teacher for help while using boy ey the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download ol anything without checking. Do not share personal information anywhere.

(4 What do I need to know before I start?

There are different types of plant nurseries - some may be for growing vegetables, and others for fruit crops, trees, flowering plants, ornamental plants and so on.

Different areas will have different kinds of nurseries. While the process of developing the nursery remains the same, the kind of plants change. In agricultural areas, you will find nurseries for vegetables like brinjal, tomato, onion, etc., and crops like banana. In urban areas, nurseries provide ornamental and flowering plants such as rose, marigold, etc. that can be kept in homes. Where possible, especially in coastal and hilly areas, horticultural nurseries for plants like mango and coconut are set up.

Nurseries can be on plots of land or on terraces of buildings. They may be large or small ones maintained at homes. Visiting any one of these will help you to prepare your nursery well. In

Now that you have learnt about what plants need for growth, start planning for setting up the school nursery. You will plant seeds in beds and seedling trays, grow new plants from stem cuttings and use them in the school or give them to others. You will also prepare nursery bags for planting and transferring plants from beds/trays to another part of the school (Figure 1.5).

Activity 2: Planning and laying out plant nursery

You have identified the plants that you © will grow during Activity 1.

Now that you have to plan the plant nursery (Figure 1.6), the first step is

Figure 1.6: Planning the layout of the plant nursery


## Plant Nursery

finding a suitable place. The selected area should preferably get at least 2-3 hours of sunlight. The place should be such that excess water (waterlogging) can be avoided.

A 150-200 square feet area should be sufficient. If land is not available on the school premises, you can utilise any unused space, pathway or parking lot or you can also create the nursery in pots (Figure 1.7). 2

Once land is identified, ~~ calculate the area of the plant Figure 1.7: Different ic sila 7 gl for nursery.

1. What is the available space for the nursery?

2. What factors were considered while choosing the particular location?

Draw a layout or sketch of the nursery with dimensions (length, width). Show as many details as you can - pathways, source of water, layout of beds, and so on.

Activity 3: Preparing land and setting up shade-net

You have made the layout of the nursery. Now, you need to prepare the land and install a shade-net to reduce sunlight so that young plants are protected from excessive heat, preventing heat stress. 1. First remove unwanted plants, debris, rocks, etc., to clean the selected area. 2. Mark the nursery boundary with lime powder. Mark important components like pathways, plant beds and so on (Figure 1.8).

Figure 1.8: Marking the nursery boundary with lime powder

3. Onthe basis of the area and your design, fix green shade-net on the nursery using bamboo or wooden poles (Figure 1.9).


## Dea ie ee

Figure 1.9: Fixing the poles at the boundary of the plant nursery

4. Choose a shade-net with appropriate shading percentage (50% or 75%), based on plant need. In case a green shade- net is not available, you can use tree branches or old cloth

(sarees) to provide shade (Figure 1.10). If you are building the nursery on a terrace or concrete floor, then you can use metal tin boxes, or a plastic drum filled with sand to fix poles for the shade-net.

Figure 1.10: Installing the green shade-net

5. Use discarded pipes/rods, bamboo or fallen branches to make a protective fence for your plant nursery. It is required to prevent entry of animals and human beings.

Once the basic structure is ready, respond to the following


## questions:

1. What kind of shade-net or clothes did you use to provide shade to the plants?

2. Which materials did you use to fix the shade-net (e.g., bamboo, wooden pole, mild steel pipe, etc.)?


## Activity 4: Germinating seeds

All seeds may not germinate after sowing. The seed germination rate tells you how many seeds are likely to germinate to become plants. It is necessary to know the germination rate to estimate the quantity of seeds required to be planted in a nursery.

This activity will help you to understand the importance of germination test.

Follow the steps in figure 1.11 to perform the seed germination test.

Figure 1.11: Steps for calculating germination percentage

Record your plants’ growth

You can create a video of seeds sprouting. You can take photographs (using a smartphone or camera) of seeds at different times. Search on the Internet using a search engine for the keywords “timelapse photo apps”. You can upload the photographs to create a video of seeds growing into sprouts and young plants.

Now, you must have understood that the germination rate helps you to estimate how many seeds need to be planted to get the required yield. This ensures that space, effort and time is not wasted. If you look at seed packet labels, you will find that the seed germination rate is mentioned on them.

Please respond to the following questions to learn more about seed germination rate.

1. Which seed did you use for conducting seed germination test?

Activity 5: Raising plants in the nursery

You have learnt about the seed germination rate.

Let us now raise the plants in the nursery. Planting materials like seeds and cuttings contain reserve food in the form of carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, and necessary nutrients. This reserve is used by seedlings during germination and _ initial growth.

Remember, the number of seeds you use must be greater than the number of plants you wish to grow.

Figure 1.14: Students digging the soil and levelling for raised-bed preparation

Step 2: Sowing seeds on raised-beds in a nursery

Now sow seeds on the raised-bed in the nursery. For this, follow the steps given below: 1. Ifseeds are very small, mix them with fine sand or soil. It will help in the easy sowing of seeds. 2. Sow the seeds on the raised-bed gently. Put soil on the seeds and water them using a water can to keep the soil moist.

Respond to the following questions after the activity: 1. Which seeds did you sow in the raised-bed?

2. What have you done to provide optimal conditions for growth of seedling?


## Method 2: Sowing seeds in plug or seedling trays

An alternative to raised plant beds is using plug/seedlings tray (Figure 1.15). It is very useful if only limited space is available and also if we want to produce seedlings on a large scale. Use trays with appropriate sized cells — small cells for delicate seedling

° ; : Figure 1.15: Seedling tray with while larger ones for bigger seedlings. saplings growing in them

Cocopeat is generally used in seedling trays as a growing media. In case seedling trays are not available, you can use coconut shells, old teacups or similar waste materials.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

18-03-2025 4.16.13 PM.

fale Did you know?

Growing media has an advantage over soil in better management of moisture around roots. It also helps in avoiding disease spread and provides nutrients for growth.

Apart from cocopeat, minerals like vermiculite and bentonite are used in plant nurseries as growing media.

For sowing seeds in a seedling tray:

1. Soak cocopeat in water - 1 kg cocopeat can absorb 5-8 litres of water.

2. After all the water is soaked, fill the trays with the soaked cocopeat gently.

3. Sow seeds (1-2 seeds per hole) and cover the tray with tarpaulin sheet or gunny bags. Keep the covered tray(s) aside for 2-3 days.

4. Once the seeds start germinating, the tray should be placed ina shade-net nursery for further growth.

After completing the activity, answer the following questions:

1. Which method did you use for sowing the seeds? (If you have used more than one method, please mention all of them.)

2. What steps have you taken to provide optimal conditions for the growth of seedlings?

Method 3: Raising plants using stem cuttings

Plants can also be propagated using stem cuttings (Figure 1.16). You can use the stem of hardwood (e.g., rose, bougainvillea), semi- hardwood (e.g., dieffenbachia, croton), or softwood (e.g., duranta, alternanthera) as planting material.

Types of stem cutting used for plant propagation

1. Softwood cuttings from shrubs or deciduous trees are cuttings that typically measure 10-15 cm in length. The top two to three leaves are retained, while the rest are removed. Retaining some leaves are crucial, as the cuttings lack sufficient food reserves. Citrus, cherry, apple, peach, plum, pear, and apricot are commonly propagated using softwood cuttings under mist chambers, whereas plants like coleus, chrysanthemum, dahlia, holy basil (tulsi) and carnation are propagated through the herbaceous method.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

Ch-1 Plant Nursery.indd 20 18-03-2025 4.16.13 PM.

2. Semi-hardwood cuttings are taken from partially mature, slightly woody shoots or tissues. These cuttings are still tender and succulent, typically prepared from the current season’s growth of trees and shrubs. This method is commonly used for propagating fruit plants such as mango, guava, lemon, jackfruit and flowering plants, such as roses.

3. Hardwood cuttings are taken from mature, woody stem material and are typically prepared during the dormant season. They are usually derived from one-year-old shoots that developed in the previous growing season. This method is commonly used for propagating plants such as grape, fig, mulberry, kiwi fruit, pomegranates, chestnut, plum, apple, and gooseberry.

1. Which kind of plants did you use for plant propagation

using cuttings? Did you use a cutting of hard, semi-hard or softwood?

Activity 6: Watching plants grow

You have used different methods of plant propagation; now maintain a record as shown in table 1.2 for your nursery.

Planting is not sufficient — you need to take care of the plants till they are mature and ready for transplantation in their beds/ pots. Young plants are very delicate, and you need to take care of them till they are strong enough. You can transplant them in the right season and right place (with suitable environment).

Many animals’ coexist peacefully with humans (Figures 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3). Beyond domestic and farm animals, several other animals share our surroundings, including crows, sparrows, pigeons, owls, kites, bats, monkeys, langurs, squirrels, mice, rats, butterflies, and moths. They lead their busy lives alongside us, adapting to the human-dominated environment.

Have you ever wondered where these animals lived before towns and cities replaced farmland and forests? How many of them have managed to adapt to the changes brought about by human expansion? As villages, towns, and cities continue to grow, natural habitats are shrinking, forcing many animals into unfamiliar territories. This habitat loss has led to an increase in sightings of leopards, wolves, and even tigers in urban areas and farmlands. Imagine being suddenly displaced from your home, losing the safety and comfort it provides—this is the challenge these animals are now facing.

Figure 2.2: Bird’s nest hanging from the Figure 2.3: White-throated Kingfisher can be seen roof of a veranda in a city on wires near water bodies or parks in cities

Animals that can adapt to changes in their habitat continue to coexist with us, while those that cannot retreat into the remaining untouched areas. Take birds, for example—specifically pigeons. Their natural habitat consists of cliffs and rocky hills, which is why they are commonly seen perched on building ledges. In contrast, house sparrows prefer sheltering in dense trees and bushes. As cities expand and green spaces diminish, the sparrow population gradually declines until they eventually disappear from urban landscapes.

All animals require food and water to survive. Additionally, they need sufficient space to move freely and a safe shelter where they can rest and raise their young ones without fear of predators or exposure to harsh weather conditions. These four essentials— space, shelter, food, and water—form the foundation of every animals’s habitat.

However, the specific needs of different animals vary. For instance, in terms of space, carpenter ants can establish a colony within just a few square centimetres, whereas spiders spin webs that are much larger than themselves. Similarly, water sources differ—while butterflies and ants can sip dew droplets from grass, birds often drink from puddles or leaking taps. Shelters also vary; squirrels find safety in trees, while lizards are comfortable on flat concrete surfaces, as few predators can climb walls to reach them.

Near human settlements, a diverse range of food is readily available, including human leftovers, flower nectar, leaves, insects, and small animals (Figure 2.4). Additionally, birds find various materials for nest-building in such areas. They collect twigs, dried vegetation, and grass to construct sturdy nests (Figure 2.5). For the nest lining, sparrows often use feathers or even paper, whereas crows incorporate metal wires and ropes to reinforce their nests.

Figure 2.4: Insect feeding on nectar of a Figure 2.5: A bird gathering material flower, also helps in the pollination for its nest

Once basic needs are fulfilled, habitats must also provide comfort and joy. For example, some birds like bulbul, dove and munia love to bathe in shallow water containers to cool down and clean their feathers.

## Ch-2 School Habitat Garden.indd 27 18-03-2025 4.17.10 PM.

Numerous initiatives have been undertaken in our country to create and maintain suitable habitats for wildlife, ensuring their protection and conservation. These efforts include the establishment of various wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, such as (i) Kaziranga National Park in Assam, renowned for its population of one-horned rhinoceroses, (ii) Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in Rajasthan, a haven for migratory birds, (iii) Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala, dedicated to tiger conservation, (iv) the Butterfly Enclosure within Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary in Sikkim, which provides a safe habitat for diverse butterfly species and (v) Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, which serves as a vital refuge for barasingha (swamp deer) and other wildlife. These are just a few examples among the many protected areas across the country.

The term ‘sanctuary’ literally means ‘a safe place where one’s needs are met.’ In the context of wildlife conservation, sanctuaries are typically vast, well-maintained areas managed by experts who ensure the protection and well-being of various species. However, the concept of a sanctuary is not limited to large-scale conservation efforts alone. Even a small habitat garden in your backyard or neighbourhood can serve as a miniature sanctuary, providing shelter, food, and a safe space for birds, butterflies, insects, and other small animals. By creating and nurturing such spaces, individuals can contribute to biodiversity conservation and support local wildlife in their own surroundings.

At the end of the project, you will be able to:

1. Identify groups of animals in and around the school that can be attracted to the habitat garden.

2. Identify the needs of these groups of animals in terms of space, shelter, food, and water.

3. Describe how these needs can be met within the school habitat garden.

Design and set up a habitat garden in your school based on the above needs.

Observe the groups of animals attracted to the habitat garden.

What will I need?

You will need tools and materials for setting up the habitat garden, along with what are referred to as non-plant elements that will attract animals.

1.

2.


## Gardening tools and materials

(a) You will need gardening tools like shovels, spades, trowels, and watering cans and safety gloves.

(b) You will also need plant seeds or seedlings, including those of flowering plants, and materials like compost to help them grow into healthy plants.

Materials for including non-plant elements to attract animals

(a) Gravel, wood chips or bricks to create garden pathways.

(b) Waste materials like old containers, discarded wood/ plywood, cardboard and old string to create shelters, feeders, and bird baths.

(c) Stones, rocks, logs, waste cardboard, and compost to create shelters for insects.

(d) Tools like hammer, and a small saw.


## (e) Nails and fasteners.

Some key precautions to be followed while creating the habitat garden are as follows:

1.

Be sensitive to the needs of animals. Take care not to disturb them.

Do not damage the habitat of animals.

Wear gloves when handling tools and materials to protect yourself.

ey anything without checking. Do not share personal information anywhere.

In order to develop the habitat garden, you must first identify animals in and around the school. Next, you must understand the needs of these animals in terms of space, shelter, food and water. After all, these animals will be attracted to the garden only if their needs are fulfilled.


## Activity 1: Identifying animals in and around the school

Spend some time looking around the school and identify the animals around you.

Next, ask the gardeners in a nearby park or members of the community living close to the school about the animals they have observed in the surroundings.

Depending on where your school Figure 2.6: Sunbird feeding on located there will be pigeons, crows, nectar also helps in pollination Sparrows, kites, peregrine falcon, bulbul, mynah, munia, sunbirds, woodpeckers, owls, and many other birds (Figure 2.6). You may find squirrels, mice, rats, bats, mongoose, and maybe some other small animals, : as well as lizards, and frogs. Insects cae fcwerine kasturtiumolant ke ants, butterflies, dragonflies,

beetles, caterpillars, mosquitoes, and many others are also likely to be around (Figure 2.7).

Make a list of the animals around you that are likely to be attracted to the habitat garden and decide which ones you would like to have in the school and which ones you would like to avoid.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

Once this list is ready, the next step would be to identify what these animals need in their habitat.


## Activity 2: Interaction with an expert

To assess the need of the animals identified by you, it will be useful to speak to an expert. The expert can be a farmer, gardener or any other community member who has a garden and an interest in animals. If possible, you can also meet a naturalist (who gains understanding of the natural world through observation over a long period of time), conservationist (who explains the need for protection of animals and give suggestions), zoologist (who studies animal behaviour), entomologist (who concentrates on insects), lepidopterist (who concentrates on butterflies and moths among insects), botanist (who studies plants), and any scientist who studies the natural world. Think of questions to ask the experts. Some questions are given below, you can think of many more. 1. Which of the animals identified in the surrounding of the school are likely to be attracted to our school habitat garden?

2. How can we prevent the entry of animals we do not want in the school habitat garden?


## School Habitat Garden


## Ch-2 School Habitat Garden.indd 31 18-03-2025 4.17.11 PM

3. Where should the habitat garden be developed?

Now fill the tables 2.2 and 2.3 with the help of the experts. Ensure that you have information for at least two types of birds, insects, and small mammals.

Fireflies are a species of insects that emit light. A few decades back, entire trees used to be lit up by small lights in some areas of our country, but this is rare now (Figure 2.8).

Fireflies live in various habitats but are mostly found in humid, warm environments. Many species thrive in forests and fields or the area between them. As forests and fields are replaced by houses and human population, fireflies are no longer found in the area. Also, as light pollution increases, fireflies cannot signal to each other. This disrupts their life cycle, and the population of fireflies decreases.

Thus, fireflies have not been able to adapt into their changed habitat. This poses a serious problem for farmers in these areas. Fireflies are very important for farmers since they feed on insects that harm crops. As their population decreases, farmers have to use chemicals to protect their crop, which in turn has harmful effects - on plants and those who consume Figure 2.8: Fireflies these plants.

Identification using apps You can use mobile applications to identify birds, butterflies and other insects. Some useful applications are: = Seek by iNaturalist (App): Helps identify insects, butterflies, birds, and animals through image recognition. = PlantNet (App): Helps identify local plant species and understand their importance in conservation. = eBird: Used for logging bird sightings and contributing to a global citizen science database. = Merlin Bird ID (App): Used for identifying bird species by sound or image. « Picture Insect (App): Used for insect identification.

## Activity 3: Identifying natural habitats

Before you start designing your habitat garden, observe the natural habitat around your school. You may have already done nature walks, this time, think of what the experts shared with you and focus on specific aspects.

To observe the behaviour of animals, you can visit nearby farmland or open areas, water bodies, a forest (including a forested area in a city), parks, large gardens, and similar places.

## Activity 4: Identifying needs of animals

You are now ready to design your school habitat garden based on the needs of animals.

Use table 2.5 to systematically write your learnings based on your interactions with experts and on your observations. This table is meant to help you identify the needs of different animals you want to attract to your habitat garden. If you still have questions, please ask the experts again.

A few examples are given to help guide you.

Did you know?

1. Some birds like the house sparrow rub their feathers with dry earth or sand while vigorously wriggling their bodies and flapping their wings. This causes dust to fly up and then fall through their feathers. Birds do this to remove any tiny insects that may have crept into their feathers and to clean their skin. This is known as dustbathing (Figure 2.10a).

2. Birds take water baths in a similar manner, by wriggling their bodies and flapping their feathers. They are happy to do this in rainwater or ina shallow pool. They do this to clean their feathers and to ensure they are well-maintained for flying (Figure 2.10b).

3. Butterflies also gather around puddles, damp soil or animal droppings. This is known as mudpuddling (Figure 2.10c). They do this to absorb nutrients and also water.

Activity 5: Designing the habitat garden

Having a clear plan is important when creating a habitat garden, as it guides the design of the space, where the garden should be developed, what needs to be added, where should it be added and how it must be maintained.

Some questions that will guide the design of the habitat garden are given below. Please keep what you have entered in table 2.2 in mind while designing your garden.

1.

3.

Where will you make the habitat garden (e.g., any open unutilised space on the school grounds or a balcony/ terrace)?

How much sunlight does the space receive during the day? (e.g., does the entire area receive fullsunlight or are some parts shaded. How many hours of direct sunlight does it receive?)

What specific elements do animals need to be attracted to your habitat garden? Consider features like flowering plants, rocks in sunny areas, plants that can ‘break’ the wind for butterflies, water collecting under a garden tap etc.

Trees or shrubs around the space are preferable as they act as natural windbreaks (row of trees, a fence, wall, or screen, that provides shelter or protection from the wind) and hideouts for animals to use as shelters.

The garden can also be developed in pots on the terrace close to the

boundary wall, which will act as a windbreak.

The garden must be in a quiet space, that is, away from much human

movement to ensure comfort of animals.


## School Habitat Garden

18-03-2025 4.17.13 PM.

4. Doany of the above already exist in the school? If yes, what are they?

6. What kind of plants will need to be planted to attract animals, birds and insects to your habitat garden (e.g., seasonal flowering plants)?

7. How will you make sure you do not disturb animals while watering and weeding your garden (e.g., a walkway of sand or brick, areas for mudpuddling in a corner of the garden)?


## Figure 2.11: A habitat garden in the making


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-2 School Habitat Garden.indd 38 18-03-2025 4.17.13 PM

Create a sketch of the layout of the habitat garden, making sure that all key elements are included in it. Add spaces for mudpuddling, basking, dustbathing, water baths, feeders, and all the plant and non-plant elements in your garden. This visual plan will help you as a guide to actually create the habitat garden (Figure 2.11).

Refer to the Activity 1, where you had identified some animals you would not like in your habitat garden. What can you do to ensure they are not attracted to your garden (e.g., ensure there is no stagnant water to prevent mosquitoes from finding a suitable habitat, keep the area tidy by removing wood stack and unused boxes, which could serve as hiding places for snakes, etc., and use natural deterrents).


## School Habitat Garden


## Ch-2 School Habitat Garden.indd 39 18-03-2025 4.17.13 PM.


## Mimicking Habitats

1. Nesting boxes for birds: You may have seen ‘nesting boxes’, these

are boxes of different shapes that birds can make nests in. You can make these using waste plywood or bamboo with some help from your teacher. The size of the entrance should match the birds you expect (e.g., small for sparrow, large for owl).

Similarly, you must have seen birds drinking and bathing in shallow containers filled with water placed by humans. You can use any discarded container to provide water to birds. Just remember to keep them at a height so they are safe from cats or dogs.


## . Waste puddles and feeders for butterflies: Butterflies, on the other

hand, do not like very deep water. For them, you can fill water containers with stones or pebbles, and sand. Add a pinch of salt and compost as well to provide nutrients. Ensure that this puddling area is always kept moist.

A butterfly feeding area can be created just like feeding areas are created for birds; both need to be at a height but the one for butterflies has to be smaller. For birds, you can put out grains and seeds, while for butterflies you can put out rotting fruit or a sponge soaked in sugar syrup.

For butterfly shelters you can make narrow and tall wooden boxes with slits instead of holes so that butterflies can enter but birds cannot. These boxes should be placed high above the ground in a place sheltered by winds.

. Shelter for beneficial insects: For insects like ladybugs and beetles,

you can create a shelter with natural materials like logs, straw, pinecones, and bricks. Simply stack these materials in layers within a wooden frame or crate. Ensure there are small gaps and crevices for insects to nest. Place these shelters near flowering plants or a compost pit, in case there is one in your school. This shelter should be placed 1-3 feet above the ground.

Wooden logs, dead tree branches, and compost heap with dry leaves attract beetles, ants and similar insects. These can be placed in the corner of the habitat garden.

Activity 6: Creating the habitat garden

Now that the design is ready, start planting the habitat garden!

The sequence of steps to be followed are given below: 1. Mark the area in the place you have identified. If land is not available, pots or planting boxes can be used.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-2 School Habitat Garden.indd 40

18-03-2025 4.17.13 PM.

2. First remove unwanted plants, debris, rocks, etc. to clean the selected area.

3. Mark the garden boundary with lime powder. Include as many existing trees or shrubs as possible.

4. Mark areas as per the layout.

5. Prepare soil by digging and loosening the soil, making planting furrows, and adding compost ™ (around 20 to 30 Kg compost for sme every 100 square metre planting * bed). If you are using pots, then Figure 2.12: Butterfly basking prepare a potting mix with 2 parts ona flat rock ina sunny area soil, 1 part compost and 1 part dry leaves or cocopeat.

6. Create a fence around the habitat garden.

As your garden grows, you can slowly add non-plant elements. Some examples are given in Figures 2.13 to 2.16.

Your habitat garden is now thriving with life. By carefully designing and nurturing it, you have created a “self-sustaining environment” that mimics a natural habitat. As plants grow and bloom, they naturally attract various insects and animals, creating a balanced ecosystem.

Flowering plants draw butterflies and small birds, while birds help control insect populations by feeding on them. The presence of insects also invites spiders, bats, lizards, and insects, which play their role in the “food chain”. Over time, these smaller creatures attract larger birds, which will add to the “biodiversity” of your garden.

Your habitat garden can now become a haven for animals, a beautiful green space, and a step towards ecological conservation.

Figure 2.17: Habitat garden in a school with a nest and a bird house Activity 7: Observing occupants of the habitat garden

Allow your habitat garden time to grow and flourish. Once it has fully developed, observe the various animals that inhabit the school habitat garden, such as butterflies, ants, small birds, lizards, and squirrels. Work in groups to document your observations.

1. Carefully observe and record the behaviour of animals around water sources and feeding areas.

2. Remember that butterflies and birds are most active during sunrise and sunset, so try to arrive at school early for better observations.


## School Habitat Garden


## Ch-2 School Habitat Garden.indd 43 18-03-2025 4.17.15 PM.

3. If possible, take photographs or sound recordings. You can also sketch the animals or include photos in your observation records.

You can note your observations in table 2.6 below.

If you are getting a lot of visitors to your habitat garden, that is wonderful! If not, do not be disappointed. You need to be patient, animals need to be confident that their needs will be met. Some animals may already be living in the school, and they may decide to use the habitat garden. Wait for some time, discuss with experts and make suitable changes.

Activity 8: Maintaining the habitat garden

The habitat garden will host living things. This includes plants, ants, insects, birds, lizards and many others. To keep your habitat garden a buzzing place, you need to maintain it regularly. Taking care of the habitat garden is important to ensure it continues to attract animals you want. You also need to take care of plants, and ensure there are no unwelcome occupants. For example, you need to water the plants, ensure there is no stagnant water to prevent mosquitoes, clear fallen leaves and stems from pathways (you can collect them and put them in a compost bed). Therefore, you must prepare a maintenance schedule for the habitat garden. You can divide yourselves into small teams and distribute the work. You must rotate the tasks so that everybody gets a chance to contribute. You can prepare a maintenance chart and keep a checklist to ensure tasks are done on time. Some examples are given in table 2.7; you can add more as per your habitat garden. Table 2.7: Maintenance schedule for the habitat garden

Every living thing is looking for a comfortable and secure habitat. Your consistent efforts in maintaining your garden will attract more and more living things to your garden.

Activity 9: Showcasing your work

Plan how you will share your habitat garden with others. To make it informative for visitors, consider labelling key features, such as: 1. Names of flowering plants 2. Animals benefiting from shelters, water containers, and feeders 3. Marked areas for mud-puddling and dust-bathing

You can also create a presentation to explain the process. This could be in the form of a chart or a digital slide presentation. Here are some key points to include:

1. Purpose: Why did you create the habitat garden?

2. Designing and Layout: How did you plan the layout based on the needs of animals?

3. Target Species: Which animals did you aim to attract, and what are their specific needs?

4. Observed: What have you noticed since setting up the garden?

This presentation will be valuable during the Kaushal Mela,

where you can use it to explain your project to visitors.

India has a rich history of textiles, with each state having its own traditional ways of weaving cloth and creating beautiful patterns using different methods, like dyeing, embroidery and printing. Some of these weaves and patterns have been used across centuries.

Among these methods is tie and dye, e.g., Lehariya, Bandhani (Figures 3.1 and 3.2). Bandhani, which literally means ‘to bind or tie’, is a resist dye technique. Resist dye techniques prevent dye from colouring some parts, so that it retains the original colour. Thus, it creates beautiful patterns.

Figure 3.2: Bandhani patterns can be created to create intricate designs

In the Bandhani method, fabric is folded, tied, twisted, and bound to prevent certain portions from being coloured. Artisans practising this method tie the fabric so that circles, spirals, stripes, and even patterns that appear like plants and animals are created. Bandhani is also known as tie and dye, and is generally practised in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Usually done on cotton, silk, and wool, traditional Bandhani is created using natural dyes made of plants and spices.

## sarees.

Thus, tie and dye came to be associated with Gujarat, Rajasthan,


## and Tamil Nadu too.

Another popular resist dye method is wax resist where wax or a starchy paste is applied either freehand or using blocks/stencils, which have patterns carved on them. These patterns can be

geometric, or in the shape of animals or plants. This is known as batik, and has traditionally been practised in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan.

Bandhani is among the oldest tie and dye techniques. The earliest evidence of Bandhani is found in the Ajanta caves in Maharashtra where paintings show a woman wearing a dotted cloth that is believed to be Bandhani (Figure 3.3).

Bandhani is not merely an Indian art form, it also reflects the rich culture of our country. Different colours and styles of Bandhani are associated with different communities and worn with pride in both Rajasthan and Gujarat (Figure 3.4). Insome communities, different types of Bandhani are associated with different rituals.

Since tie and dye products are created by hand, and no two artisans will tie the fabric in the same way, no two pieces are alike. Thus, each pattern is unique.

This project will help you create your own unique tie and dye product.

Prepare a product using tie and dye.

What will I need?

You will need different kinds of tools and materials before you start working:

Tools and Materials required

Fabric: Fabric used for Bandhani must be strong since it has to undergo multiple rounds of tying and dyeing. Hence, fabric made of natural fibres is used, e.g., cotton, silk, wool. You can use light coloured thin cotton fabric cut out of old clothes. If there are light-coloured linen or silk clothes that have been discarded at home, you can use them as well. You must ensure no traces of starch or dirt remain by washing the fabric carefully.

Material for tying: Thread for tying must be white or very light coloured. This is to avoid the colour from ‘bleeding’ from the thread, that is, to prevent the colour of the thread itself from dyeing the fabric. Rubber bands and clips can also be used if large portions are to resist the dye. Grains, pulses, seeds, small stones, peppercorns, etc., can be used to ensure that the area that resists the dye is of the desired size.

Material for dyeing and fixing: Natural dyes can be made using a variety of materials, e.g., beetroot, coffee, turmeric, red cabbage, pomegranate, henna, spinach,


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

18-03-2025 4.56.01 PM.

orange peels, onion skin and indigo. To ensure the colour of the dye does not wash out or fade too soon or bleed from your product onto other clothes (e.g., on a shirt you are wearing), you will need fixers. For example, salt/ Figure 3.5: Nakhli used by artisans vinegar is used to fix the dye when flowers or leaves are

## stirrers, iron, mug, plates, scissors, tongs, glass, bowl.

The following precautions need to be taken during various tasks involved in tie and dye techniques:

1. Wear gloves to protect your hands from warm dyes, and aprons to protect your clothes while using dyes. Use masks to avoid colour splashing on your mouth and prevent breathing in any vapour from the hot dye. Wear goggles to keep your eyes safe from hot water.

2. Work in a well-ventilated area so that smells and vapours do not irritate you.

3. Handle scissors with care while cutting fabric — never point the scissors towards yourself or anyone else.

4. Carefully dispose off any leftover dye solution in the sink. While using the dye, spread plastic sheets on the surface to prevent splashes and to keep the work area safe and clean.

Now, compare the patterns you have drawn with those drawn by your peer. Discuss them with your peer.

Some other tie and dye techniques Two examples of popular shaped resist tie and dye techniques besides Bandhani are given below:

1. Leheriya: Made by folding and tying the fabric before dyeing. This results in a wave-like pattern. The word leher means ‘wave’. It represents the flow of water and greenery, which hold high significance in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat.

2. Shibori: Shibori is an ancient Japanese tie and dye technique. The word Shibori means to ‘wring, squeeze or press’. Traditional Shibori often used natural indigo dye, which changes colour from green to blue as the fabric reacts with air during drying.

Before you start making your own tie and dye patterns, you need to identify which fabric should be used. It will be useful to understand which fabrics and patterns are popular, and likely to sell. You can also compare the cost of tie and dye products with other products.

One way to do this would be to visit a shop selling clothes. You could also interact with a local boutique owner or a fashion designer.

Visiting a tie and dye workshop will help you to gain firsthand knowledge of the process. You could also invite an artisan to your school to give a demonstration. However, if it is not possible to get an artisan, even a person who does tie and dye as a hobby could be invited.

It is quite possible that a tie and dye workshop is not present in the vicinity. In that case, you can visit a dyeing workshop to get an understanding of the process.


## Activity 1: Visit to a shop

You will observe many types of products in the shop, made of different fabrics using different methods, like weaving, embroidery, dyeing, and so on (Figure 3.7).

While in the shop, try to get a feel of different fabrics by touching them. See if you can find Bandhani/ Batik/Shibori or any other kind of tie and dye designs.

Before the visit, think of the questions you would like to ask | the shopkeeper. Some pointers are given in table 3.1 but please add to these. Get responses

for at least five types of Figure 3.7: Range of products made of different fabrics fabrics using different methods 1CS.

Activity 3: Exploring the art of tie and dye

Before you make your product, you must practice and experiment with fabrics, dyes and designs. First, make some samples on a small piece of fabric.

Step 1: Prepare the sample fabrics

Get five handkerchief-sized (6 x 6 inches) fabrics. These fabrics could be from an old shirt, kurta, saree or anything that is not in use any more. You can use different kinds of fabric— thin cotton, thick cotton, silk, linen or any other fabric to see the difference in results. Remember to start with white or light-coloured fabrics so you can see your designs better. Figure 3.10 shows how the fabric is to be prepared.

Step 1: Cut the fabric Step 2: Wash to remove Step 3: Dry the fabric and any starch to dirt iron it to remove any crease

Figure 3.10: Preparing fabric for tie and dye

Write the details of the fabrics you are going to use in table 3.2 below:

Step 2: Tying the fabric

You have already read that when we tie the fabric, we prevent the part that has been tied from getting coloured by dye. This resisting of the dye creates patterns due to the difference between the parts that are dyed and not dyed. Tying the fabric in different ways will create different and unique design(s).

Experts can tie and dye the same fabric multiple times to introduce colours in the patterns — this is done by dyeing the fabric multiple times, each time tying different parts of the fabric to get a different colour and pattern. However, we will stick to two colours — the original colour of the fabric and the colour of the dye.

The technique for tying fabric for Bandhani, Shibori and Leheriya is given in figures 3.11 to 3.13, respectively.


## Bandhani tying technique

Step 1: Draw a design on the fabric Step 2: Place a mustard seed on using tiny circles/dots. the fabric where you want the design element to appear. Pincha small portion of the fabric around the seed using your fingers.

Step 3: Pull the seed up with the fabric and tie it tightly with the thread. Repeat the process for the design you would like to create .


## Figure 3.11: Tying technique for Bandhani

Traditionally, Bandhani patterns are given different names depending on the number of knots in the design. Larger designs are made by repeating these patterns. Some examples are given in table 3.3; try to make your own design using any of these.

Step 3: Continue stitching until your Step 4: Gently pull the loose ends entire pattern is outlined with the of the thread to gather the fabric, running stitches. Keep the stitches creating folds. The tighter you pull,

loose, as they will be gathered later. the more distinct your design will be.

Step 5: Once gathered, tie a firm knot at the end of the thread to hold the folds in place. Make sure it is tight, so the dye does not seep into the folded areas.

You can vary the pattern by varying the length of the stitches, the angle of the lines, and where and how tightly you tie the thread.

You can vary the design by decreasing or increasing the number of pleats, as well as the distance at which you tie the thread.


## Figure 3.13: Tying technique for Leheriya

Now, you are ready to tie your first sample. First, think of a design, draw it on the fabric and then tie your first sample fabric. Do not tie and dye all samples together. Doing one sample at a time will help you improve your tying technique. You can decide which technique to use; however, it is recommended you try more than one technique.

## Step 3: Preparation of dye

Different kinds of dyes, both chemical and natural, are available in the market. Of these, natural dyes are more environment friendly.

To prepare natural dyes, select the ingredients based on the colour you want (e.g., turmeric/marigold flowers for yellow, beetroot for pink, spinach leaves for green, blue hibiscus/ blueberry/blue pea flower for blue).

Step 3: Once the mixture has cooled down, strain the liquid using a cotton cloth or a strainer to remove any solid pieces, leaving only the coloured liquid.

Step 4: Finally, add one to two tablespoons of salt to the dye solution. This acts as a fixer, and helps set the colour, making it more effective for dyeing fabric.

Your natural beetroot dye is now ready to use. The quantity of the plant (vegetable/flower/fruit) and water will depend on the shade of colour needed and the weight of the fabric — the darker the shade and the heavier the fabric, the more quantity is required.

Did you know?

Heating plays an important role in the dyeing process as it increases the solubility of dye in water, speeds up the dyeing process, and helps fix the dye to the fabric. However, there are some dyes and processes which require no or minimal heating. While there are several techniques, two are mentioned here:


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

Ch-3 Tie and Dye.indd 70 18-03-2025 4.56.06 PM.


## Passive heating process

If time is not a constraint, then dye can be prepared using solar energy. This would require putting the dye and fabric in a glass jar and placing it in a sunny spot to slowly extract the dye with minimal heat. This process can take several days to weeks, depending on the shade of colour you want - the darker the shade, the longer it takes.


## Cold water dyes

Cold water dyes, which use chemicals to fix the dye instead of heat, are available in the market. The dye is mixed in cold water or water at room temperature. Tied fabric is soaked in the dye, and then ina solution made with a fixer before the final rinsing.

Table 3.5 has other examples of preparing dye of different colours from plants.

## Challenge

Try this solution

Did the thread break or open during the dyeing process?

Tie the fabric tightly and handle it carefully to ensure that it does not loosen during the process.

Did you spill the dye solution during the process?

Ensure that there is enough space where you are working to keep the dye and other material. Use a cloth or gloves to hold the hot container.

Did you cut the fabric while untying the fabric by mistake?

Do not use scissors to cut the thread. You can use the needle to find the point of thread and use your hand to further untie it.

After trying your hand at 5 samples, you have learned the stepwise process of tie and dye. Now, you are ready to create a product you can use.


## Step 1: Selection of a product

Select a product that you would like to create, e.g., dupatta, pillow cover, scarf, or dress material. First, select the fabric—try and find old clothes at home that are not worn anymore or old bedsheets, and cut them as needed. Figure 3.18 shows a size chart for some of the products.

After you decide your design(s), choose the dye colour and the tie and dye technique. 1. What is your design inspiration?

2. Draw the design you want on your product in the box.

3. Which plant (vegetables/flowers/fruits) or other materials (e.g., tea, coffee) will you use to prepare the dye?

Step 3: Tie and dye the product

It is time to bring your tie and dye dream to life. Prepare your fabric and make it ready for the tying and dyeing process. Follow your design and create patterns by tying the fabric in creative ways.

Make sure you follow all the safety rules. You have a bigger cloth this time than your sample fabrics, therefore use 2-3L of water to make a larger quantity of plant dye. After dyeing the fabric, leave it to dry for a day.

The final step is untying the dried fabric carefully to reveal your unique design. Once the knots are undone, iron your product to smoothen out any wrinkle. The heat of the iron must be selected according to the fabric.

Ze Did you know?

Some modern tie and dye artists use a technique called reverse tie and dye. Instead of adding dye to fabric, they remove colour using bleach or other chemicals to create striking white patterns against a dark background.

What do we mean by intelligence?

Intelligence is the ability to learn and to use what you have learnt in new situations. Intelligence keeps growing — the more we deal with new situations, the more our intelligence grows.

With advances in technology, machines are also becoming intelligent, just like humans. This is known as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and it is progressing very rapidly —- what we did not imagine even a few years back is possible now (Figure 4.1).

Before learning about AI, let us discuss how we learn. Imagine that, on the first day of school, you meet many new people. Your brain will try to remember their faces and names, but you may not be able to remember all of them. After few meetings and interactions, your brain will start recognising each person and recalling their names as soon as you see them. After few days of interaction, you will be able to recall many qualities of that person.

Al works in a similar way. For example, if we want a machine to recognise an image, we need to show different images of the same object. We do this by uploading these images with proper instructions. Suppose, we want a machine to recognise a banyan tree. We will upload many different images — banyan tree in the shade, in light, different stages of growth (including many pictures of saplings), from different angles, in different geographies, full photos, partial photos — this will have to be done carefully to ensure the machine has maximum possible data related to how a banyan tree looks.

We also need to teach the machine to associate images with their name — in this case, ‘banyan tree’. Slowly, as you upload more data and associate it with the name, the machine will start recognising images, even those it has never seen before and connect them to the correct name. You can even teach the machine to connect to other information related to the banyan tree. In this way, you can keep adding the connections the machine can make — e.g., scientific name, conditions for growth, uses, animals who live in it, and whatever else may be useful for humans. This process is called ‘Machine Learning’, and AI makes it possible.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-4 AI Assistant.indd 84

18-03-2025 4.25.52 PM.

Similarly, you can teach the machine to recognise audio recordings of music and sounds — e.g., with a different tone, using different musical instruments — and video recordings — e.g., different backgrounds, different angles.

AI is being used in various ways to help humans. AI can be used to automate repetitive tasks, thus, reducing human efforts and increasing productivity.

As its use increases, and scientists and engineers explore how it can be expanded, it is fast becoming a part of our everyday lives.

Right now, we use AI without even thinking of it. Various apps for navigation while driving, image recognition, translation, and so on are part of our lives. You may have heard of robots that help doctors operate from a city far away from the patient, or robots who can teach students. Till few years back, some of these functions of AI were part of science fiction books and films. And now they are fast becoming a reality.

Even though AI may keep learning by itself, as it gathers more information there are certain things it cannot do. For example, can we teach AI to feel emotions? AI may be able to identify various aspects of nature that make it beautiful, but it will be able to convey that an artwork makes you feel good only when you train it to do so — it will never be able to feel emotions as humans do.

At the end of the project, you will be able to: 1. Understand how AI can be a useful tool for humans. 2. Collect data that can be used to create an AI Assistant. 3. Trainamachineto recognise data based on your instructions. 4. Create an AI Assistant to help someone learn about your locality.

(4 What do I need to know before I start?

Before you start, you should know basic functions on the computer, and how to use the Internet. You should be able to take photographs and upload them.

But, before you begin, the first thing you must do is to understand what AI can and cannot do. Once you understand this, you will be able to make decisions about what the AI Assistant should do.


## Activity 1: Human vs Machine: Who is Better at What?

Start by exploring three tasks related to what makes humans and machines special, and discovering how both work.

1. The speed with which a machine and you can calculate: Speed Test. You can do this using pen and paper, and a calculator. You can use a watch or borrow your teacher’s smartphone to keep track of time.

2. Check how accurately a machine can guess what you have drawn: The Creative Guessing Game. Use ‘Quick Draw’ or a similar drawing game. Draw and let the computer guess what it is.

3. Compare who can better guess the time taken to reach school: The Prediction Test. Think of how long it usually takes to reach school. Pick any date and predict how long you will take to reach school. Now, ask Google Maps how long it will take. Compare the predictions.

Machines are faster in terms of computing. They can guess accurately when sufficient information is available but may not be able to guess accurately if they need more information. Do you agree? Discuss among yourselves.

Activity 2: AI can see, listen and speak

Al can help people see, listen and speak — after it has been taught to do so.

For example, modern hearing aids for people with hearing loss use AI to suppress unwanted noises and amplify other sounds. Thus, a person can hear human speech clearly while the background noise fades into the background. AI can even improve the quality ofwhatis spoken. Some Al tools can distinguish between different speakers, so that the user can follow conversations correctly. Thus, AI can listen.

x") Did you know?

Prof. Stephen William Hawking was a famous scientist, who made many important discoveries about the universe. But what was unique about him was that he was suffering from an illness from the age of 21 years that led to slow paralysis of his entire body. Gradually, he lost the ability to speak.

However, Prof. Hawking used AI to communicate. Initially, he used a system that helped him select words on a computer screen by tracking movements of his cheek muscles. figure 4.3: Prof Stephen The words he selected were converted to speech. Hawking

Alcan help people with visual impairment through AI enabled glasses with sensors that can detect light and images. Thus, AI can see.

AI can also use recordings of people who have lost their voice to help them speak even if they are unable to do so themselves.

Discuss as a group how these capabilities of AI can be helpful for humans. Write Figure 4.5: A student using an AI tool to identify the ideas you come up with a plant below.


## Activity 3: Is AI creative?

We have learnt that Alcan see, listen and speak. It can differentiate between what is important for the user and what is not, and provide useful information. But can it ‘think’, ‘observe’ and ‘feel’ like humans can?

Suppose, you had to tell someone about your trip to a mela or celebration of a festival or visit to a place of historic or tourist interest.


## Al Assistant

What will your story be about? Write the idea of your story ina single sentence below:

Write about everything that made the visit special for you. Describe what you saw (e.g., colours, interesting things to eat, shops with exciting games), what you heard (e.g., music, games, laughter), about the food and drink you had, and how you felt (e.g., excitement, heat, or wind). Then ask AI to create a similar story using your story idea as a prompt.

To get an AI tool to write or draw something, you need to write a ‘prompt’ for it to give you the correct result. An ‘AI prompt’ is usually more detailed than search words. It can be a set of instructions or questions to help AI generate a specific ‘reply’ to your prompt.

Compare your story with the AI version. Was Al’s story different from yours? Yes/No

You can search for AI tools to write a story. One example is the AI tool GenerateStory.io. You can search for other AI tools as well using the keywords, AI to generate a story.

1. What details were similar and different between the story you had written, and the one AI had written?


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

Now, let us learn how AI can help to make your story better. Add more details to the prompt you had originally given an AI. Think of what you would have liked the AI to add to the story.

1. Write the new prompt in the

2. What is the difference between the story AI had written by itself and the one it wrote with your help? Do you think it is better than the previous one? Yes/NO w.eeeesesseseeeeesseeenee

If not, improve the prompt and try again.

Of course, AI will never be able to write a story like you do,

but it can do other things to help you (Figure 4.6).

Draw a picture of the place your story is about or anything that is part of your story (e.g., giant wheel, ice cream cart, puppet show). Try to include as many details as you can.

You can ask AI to clean up your rough sketches and make them look neat. Search online with keywords — AI for enhancing your handmade drawing. An example of such a tool is AutoDraw.

For example, the rough sketch of a food cart has been cleaned up using AutoDraw (Figure 4.7).

Compare the pictures.


## Figure 4.7: Using AutoDraw

Thus, AI and you can help each other.

Ch-4 AI Assistantiindd 93 18-03-2025 4.25.54 PM.


## Activity 4: Preparing to design own AI Assistant

Imagine yourself as someone who has moved into a locality with their family. Everything is new, especially if you have moved to another district or state. You need to learn about the places to eat, to buy something you need, local customs, places of historic interest, and so on. Along with useful information, you would also like to know what makes that place special.

So, if you had to help someone who has moved into your locality, what would you tell them?

Discuss among your friends what are the most important things to know about your locality. You could ask someone who recently moved into the neighbourhood, a community elder, your parents and teachers for their views.

Few examples of different categories you can find out about are given below. ‘Sub-categories’, that is, specific examples of each of the categories are given in the brackets:

1. Popular food in the locality (e.g., different kinds of food,


## drink, fruits, snacks).

2. Plants that grow in the locality (e.g., trees, flowering plants, bushes, shrubs, vegetables, farm crops).

3. Animals found in the locality (e.g., birds, insects and other animals).

4. Popular music in the locality (e.g., folk music, popular music).

5. Popular dance forms in the locality (e.g., folk, classical, contemporary dance).

6. Places of tourist interest (e.g. historical buildings, old markets, parks).

7. Communication (e.g., greetings like Juley in Ladakh and Johar in Jharkhand; common queries like “Do you have milk?”, “Where can I buy a ticket from?”

8. Any other things you can think of?

Once you have a list of what people should learn about the

locality, youstill need to decide how you willshare this information with them.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

Ch-4 Al Assistant.indd 94 18-03-2025 4.25.54 PM.

You can do this by making your own AI Assistant using a computer/tablet/smartphone. We will use the term ‘machine’ for all three.

Thus, the next task is to decide what kind of data you will collect to help people.

Data is any type of information that we can see, hear, or record. It can be

in many forms, like words, numbers, pictures, sounds, or even videos. For this project, we will focus on Image Data; you can decide to take up Audio Data and Video Data if you wish.

While you can decide whether you want to collect data for all the categories, different groups of students can take responsibility for different categories, so that you collect a lot of information.

Preferably, you should collect data with the help of a camera, but if for some reason you are unable to do so, search for relevant images on the Internet.

The first step in making the AI Assistant is to collect different kinds of data related to the same object.

To understand how to do so, take the example of Aisha.

Aisha’s mother is a fruit seller, and Aisha wants to help her sort the varieties of mangoes while purchasing them from the market. She decides to use AI by training her ‘machine’ to sort different types of fruits, especially the many varieties of mangoes.

Table 4.4: Training the machine to sort mangoes


## Category Mango Sub-category | Alphonso Himsagar Malgova Raspuri Add Image


## Data

As a first step Aisha collects data in the form of images of different kinds of mangoes she is interested in.


## Al Assistant


## Ch-4 AI Assistantiindd 95

18-03-2025 4.25.55 PM.

Aisha takes photos of mangoes and also searches online for clear images of each variety of mango. She collects at least 12-15 different images for each variety to make sure there is enough data for the AI to learn better. Figure 4.8 shows the variety of images Aisha chooses.


## Different Angles

Figure 4.8: Aisha categorises fruits into mangoes and then different varieties of mangoes into sub-categories

You do

Now collect image data for your category/categories. Remember, you need to source a variety of photographs like Aisha.

Check each image: Is it clear? Is there a shadow? Will you use all the images, or will you discard some of them?


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

Activity 5: Teaching the machine to recognise images

Once you have collected the data, you must teach the AI Assistant to respond when a user asks for information. This response will be based on the data you have uploaded (Figure 4.9). So, you must teach the AI Assistant to select the right data when the right prompt is given. For example, if a prompt is related to plants, the Al Assistant must pull out the right data.

You can search online for different ‘machine learning models for image recognition’. As an example, we will use Google’s Teachable Machine.

If you need additional guidance — you can search online using the keyword: Teachable Machine AI Tutorial.

Follow Aisha as she proceeds with creating her AI Assistant.

Aisha creates folders for each sub-category of mangoes (e.g., Alphonso,


## Ratnagiri).

You do

You have uploaded your data and placed it in folders with different names that will help you immediately recognise what kind of information

is stored.

You can also create more sub-categories (e.g., within plants—vegetable,


## flowering, fruit).

Please note the details of the data and store the data in different folders as per the categories and sub-categories.

## Activity 6: Training for recognition

Now that you have uploaded the data, you have to train the machine to recognise images. Follow Aisha’s example (Figure 4.10).

Step 1: Opens a new image project in Teachable Machine. She uploads the images into their respective categories


## Step 2: Labels sub-categories

Fill table 4.7 with the labels (names) of sub-categories you chose.

Table 4.7: Labels for training the model


## Categories Labelling (renamed sub-categories)


## Alphonso Mango_Alphonso

Now, the machine has the data you uploaded and organised. You have also trained the machine and created an AI Assistant. Now, it is necessary to test it.

If there are any errors, you need to upload more data and train the model once again.


## Activity 7: Testing and improving

To test your AI Assistant, first try it out yourself and then ask a friend to try it out and give you feedback. Once again, follow Aisha’s example.

Aisha tests her model through 2 approaches: (i) Uploading new images of mangoes. (ii) Holding an actual mango in front of the webcam (real-time testing).

When the AI model does not detect images in a category correctly, she adds more images to that category and retrains the model.

Figure 4.11: Training and exporting the model After training the model, Aisha saves her project by clicking on Export Model-»Download Model (Figure 4.11).


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-4 AI Assistant.indd 100

18-03-2025 4.25.57 PM.

Test your trained model by either uploading new images or using real time testing through the webcam. If the model makes errors, gather additional images for the problematic category, upload them, and retrain to improve accuracy. 1. Did you upload a new image or use a webcam to do real time testing?

2. Did the AI model recognise the images correctly? Yes/No _ .........

3. If it did not, it could be because it needs more and different kinds of data belonging to the category you choose. According to you, what kind of data will be needed by the AI model to recognise the image correctly?

Activity 8: Making the AI Assistant interactive and sharing it

Now that you have made the AI Assistant, you can make it more interactive and creative by adding characters and animation through Scratch AI (Figure 4.12). Search with the keywords MIT, AI Raise Playground and open the playground.

Using AI Raise Playground you can make your AI model interactive by: 1. Choosing a character for your assistant (e.g., a friendly guide or a historical figure). 2. Plan the questions the assistant will ask, like ‘Do you want to learn about our local heritage or wildlife?’. 3. Adda personality to your assistant. Decide how it will talk (fun, serious) and if it will use animation. You can also explore tutorials and other creative examples of AI projects by going to ‘See Examples’ section on the MIT AI Raise Playground homepage.

Did you know that Teachable Machine is not just for recognising images? You can also use it to train AI with audio data. You can follow the following steps:

1.

2.


## Classification: Select audio types, e.g., different languages, bird sounds.

Data Collection and Training: Record more than ten sound clips per category, ensuring variety in timing and location. Organise the clips into folders, upload them to Teachable Machine, and train the model.

Testing and Improvement: Test the AI model with new audio clips. If the AI struggles, add more examples and retrain.

What did you enjoy doing?

What were the challenges you faced? What will you do differently next time? Flowchart (Putting it all together)

To complete your project, you followed a series of planned steps. Before starting any project, it is useful to estimate the time and resources needed to complete the task (devices, camera, people required to do the work, and anything else you think is important). This will help you complete the task as planned in a timely manner. It is also useful for anyone else who wants to help you with the task.

Similarly, when you work with machines, it is necessary to make a detailed list of instructions for getting the work done through the machine. Therefore, programmers write down the detailed instructions systematically— this is called an ‘algorithm’.

Everyone, young and old, likes to listen to stories. Storytelling has been prevalent from ancient times and different forms of storytelling have evolved over time. The paintings in the Ajanta caves in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in Maharashtra, made between the second century BCE and fifth century CE, are one form of storytelling—they depict stories from the Jataka tales through paintings.

India also has a tradition of oral storytelling, which has continued until today, through Baul songs in Bangla, Dastangoi in Urdu, Katha in different languages, Kavad in Rajasthan, Yakshagana in Kerala and Karnataka, and Ram Leela across the country. Kavad is narrated using a wooden shrine that opens as the story unfolds. Yakshagana and Ram Leela use music, masks, and costumes, along with dialogues. Traditionally, these performances were done without a written script.

Figure 5.2: Shadow puppet show uses light and the shadow of puppets to tell stories from our ancient epics

The forms in which stories are told keep changing—for example, in modern times, writing is a popular form ofstorytelling. Along with writing, photography, cinema, animation, and many other forms are used for storytelling.

Sadly, some of the traditional forms are not as popular as they were till a few decades back — some people prefer more modern forms of storytelling. But one form that has persisted is using puppets to tell stories (Figures 5.1 and 5.2).

Puppets are human or animal figures that can be moved by the puppeteer. Therefore, a clockwork doll will not be considered a puppet but a simple sock with eyes, nose, and mouth stitched

on it will be considered a puppet if it moves with the help of the puppeteer.

Puppetry is the art of moving puppets either by hand, rods or strings to narrate a story. You may have already learnt about puppets in Art Education. You might have also learnt about the different kinds of puppets used in our country.

The advantage of puppetry is that you can put up a show with even one or two humans and a few puppets. This show can be easily taken from place to place and used to narrate a variety of stories.

Puppet shows have been used to share sensitive social messages that people may hesitate to discuss otherwise or even to involve people who may otherwise stay aloof. Since the puppet, and not the human is speaking, the audience will listen and laugh about things that would otherwise make them angry or upset. For example, puppets have been used to discuss addiction, superstition and other ills in society. They have been used to motivate people to act against injustice.

<“-+/ Did you know?

Between 2012 and 2014, archaeologists excavated a site belonging to the Sindhu-Sarasvati civilisation at Karanpura in Rajasthan, situated along the river Chautang.

Among the many discoveries was what appeared to be a puppet- headed bull (Figure 5.3). Although its head is missing, archaeologists have observed that the shape of the artefact is such that a detachable head could be placed on it. There are also two shallow grooves through which a string could be passed to make the head move.

Precautions you need to follow while designing and putting up the puppet show are:


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 112 18-03-2025 4.27.15 PM.

1. Please use the tools as per instructions and follow necessary safety precautions.

2. It is possible that your workspace will have lots of raw materials, and semi-finished work. Sometimes semi- finished work is delicate; you must store it safely to avoid accidental or unintended damage.

3. Workin a properly ventilated and well-lit room.

4. While writing the script and during the performance, be sensitive to others’ sentiments and spread positive messages. In case you are drawing inspiration from real life for your story, ensure you get permission from the people concerned.

as What do I need to know before I start?

Before you start thinking of the story you will narrate and the puppets you will make, it is important to think about what will interest people in your puppet show.

Activity 1: What makes stories work?

Think of the stories you have heard from various people or seen on a stage or ina film.

Remember the story you most enjoyed hearing, the one you wanted to hear again and again. Think of what you liked about that story.

1. Who told the story?

2. How did they tell the story? Did they recite it, or keep changing their voice? Did they use any props, modulate


## Storytime with Puppets


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 113 18-03-2025 4.27.16 PM.

their voice, use actions and change expressions as they told the story?

The most important thing for a story is holding the listeners’ attention. Discuss your responses with your peers and see if you identified some common elements that made storytelling interesting.

On the basis of this discussion, what would you do to make a story exciting for listeners?

Activity 2: Watching a puppet show

Check if there is any puppet show taking place near you. If not, you can invite a puppeteer to school to put up a show.

Discuss the types of puppets with the puppeteers. Observe the puppet’s mechanism—how the puppeteer moves it, who he/she looks at, their dress, style of holding the puppet and most importantly, voice modulation. If it is a live performance or a play with human actors or a puppet show, observe the stage arrangement, background, sound and light.

After watching the puppet show, please respond to the following questions:

1. What was the name of the puppet show? Where did you watch it?


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 114 18-03-2025 4.27.16 PM.

2. What kind of puppets were used in the show (e.g., king, lion, bird)? What do you think the puppets were made of?

3. What was the puppeteer doing? How was he/she moving the puppet? Did the puppeteer interact with the audience or with the puppet? If yes, how?

4. What was the most interesting scene in the puppet show? Why did you find it interesting?

5. Were elements, like sound, light, backdrop or anything else used that made the show interesting?

In case you are not able to see a live puppet show, you can search for a video of a puppet show online using the keywords ‘puppet show + language’ (your choice).

The first step towards putting up a puppet show is to identify a story and write a script. Once that is done, you have to make puppets according to the characters in the story and then design the puppet show. Finally, you have to set up the stage and put up a show.


## Storytime with Puppets


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 115 18-03-2025 4.27.16 PM.

Activity 3: Selecting/writing a story

Before you start making puppets, you should be clear about the story you want to present.

You can go to the school library and read books to get ideas. Or you can use something you are learning about in other subjects, e.g.,a story or poem from language or a historical event in science or social science. You can also select a story your grandparents tell you. Alternatively, you can think about designing a puppet show around social issues, e.g., Swachh Bharat, polio vaccination or on the rights and responsibilities of citizens.

Remember, you have to make puppets, write a script and put on a show. Therefore, your story must be short and simple, but with some drama and/or action in it.

Which story did you select and why?

Next, you need to identify the key elements of the story. Table 5.1 will help you in doing so.

Table 5.1: Key elements of the selected story

Questions Answers based on the story

What is the story about?

What is its title?

Who are the characters in the story? Describe them briefly.

Where is the story set?


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

Does the setting of the story change as it progresses?

What is the plot of the story?


## Write the sequence of the main events.

What is the central message of the story?

Activity 4: Writing a script for the puppet show

When you see a live performance or watch a film, there are dialogues, changes in scenes, music, action, and many other things. It is much more than just narrating a story. Translating a story into a show is done using a script.

A script has the step-by-step flow of scenes, dialogues and emotions of the characters. It also contains details, like the position and movement of the puppet(s) during each scene. Elements like short songs or poems, light and sound effects, and so on must be mentioned in the script. The style of speaking has to be made clear, e.g., natural, casual, formal, authoritative, submissive, and so on depending on the character and the scene.

Try and select a story that has at least 2-3 characters. These characters can be animals, humans, aliens — as per the story.

To help you understand how to write the script, an example of a story called ‘Gopal and the Hilsa Fish’ is given in Table 5.2. This story is about a king who does not like people talking about the Hilsa fish in the court. He challenges Gopal, his courtier, to buy a huge Hilsa fish and bring it to the palace without anyone talking about it. Gopal accepts the challenge. He shaves half his beard and smears ash on himself. People are so surprised by his appearance that they do not talk about the big Hilsa fish in his hand.

Please note that props are objects other than puppets (Figure 5.4) used on stage. They are used to clearly show the setting (e.g., the king’s throne) and can easily be moved around (e.g., Hilsa fish, sword, ball, car, newspaper). While some of these are placed on the stage, others can be moved around if attached to a string or stick.

S. Character Dialogue and Props Special effects (e.g., No. style required light and sound)


## Scene 1


## Activity 5: Character sketch

Before you make your puppets, you have to imagine how they would be as people. Would they be tall or short? Would they be cheerful or grumpy? Would they be outgoing or shy? These are known as characteristics. Deciding the characteristics of your puppet is known as making a character sketch. This is necessary for deciding the face and body of the puppet, its expression, its voice, and mannerisms, for example, jumping up and down when

excited, slumping when sad (Figure 5.5).

You need not make the puppet exactly like an animal or human figure — often, puppets have elongated bodies, arms and hands. However, to get a complete idea of the puppet, you need to

imagine both its body and _ Figure 5.5: A scene from a story about a scared lion and his mouse friend. The lion is made of paper and

its personality. the mouse is a sock puppet.

Using graph paper makes drawing easier

Suppose, your story has a rabbit. You can draw a rabbit on paper and paste it on cardboard. You can then attach a stick to the cardboard to move your rabbit puppet.

To draw the rabbit, take a picture of a rabbit, tracing paper and graph paper.

Draw the rabbit on the tracing paper and paste it on the graph paper. Next, draw lines proportionate to the graph on the chart paper you want to draw the rabbit on - this will help you make a larger rabbit. You can now copy each part of the rabbit onto the chart paper. Erase the lines once you are done and colour your rabbit (Figure 5.6). Once the stick is pasted to the body of the rabbit, your puppet is ready.

These questions will help you plan how to make the puppets.

1. Which puppets will you make? Draw them in the space below.

2. What are their main characteristics?


## Activity 6: Making puppets

You can make puppets with materials available around you - clay, soft wood, grass, wastepaper, used bottles, thermocol, cardboard or any other suitable material. For example, you can stick cutouts of fish drawn on chart paper around a broomstick and move them to narrate a simple story set in the sea. You can stick a piece of chart paper around a broomstick and then paste nose, eyes, ears made of chart paper or of materials like wool.

Some examples of materials and objects that you can use to create puppets are given in figures 5.7 to 5.13. Do try out other materials and see what you can do.


## Storytime with Puppets


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 121 18-03-2025 4.27.17 PM.

1. Sock puppets

You can make sock puppets simply by taking old socks and sewing eyes, nose and mouth on them. You can even sew some old wool to the sock to create hair.

You can move sock puppets by wearing them

over your hand (Figure 5.7). Figure 5.7: Sock puppets with hair stitched on with wool


## Spoon and fork puppets

You can make puppets using steel or wooden spoons and forks (even ice cream spoons and disposable forks). You can simply paint a face on the spoon and wrap some husk on the fork and then paint a face on it (Figure 5.8).

Figure 5.8: Making spoon and fork puppets

You can also decorate these puppets with clothes made of paper and colour them using sketch pens or pencils.

You can move these puppets using the handles of the spoon and fork.


## Slipper/shoe puppets

You can paint the sole of a shoe or tie/paste wool for hair and moustache. You can stick buttons for eyes or simply paint them (Figure 5.9).

You can move these puppets by holding the sides of the slipper or wearing the shoe on your hand.

4. Ball puppets

You can create faces with balls—just insert a broomstick into the bottom of a ball so that you are able to move it. You can paint a face on the ball puppet or stick pieces of paper cut to resemble noses and ears to the sides of the

5. Vegetable puppets

You can also create puppets using vegetables, like potatoes, and toothpicks. You can use other vegetables, like radish and carrot to create a nose, mouth and eyes (Figure 5.11).

You can move these puppets using the sticks.

6. Leaf puppets

You can create puppets with leaves too. These can either be dried leaves that do not break easily or green leaves. If you are using green leaves, you can use the attached twigs to create hands and arms (Figure 5.12).

You can move these puppets holding them where you want.

(a) Figure 5.12: (a) Leaf puppet made of leaves and stems (b) Puppet made of dried leaves.

7. Cardboard puppets

You can create puppets with discarded cardboard too (Figure 5.13). Besides the body, you can cut and stick small pieces of cardboard to resemble eyes, nose, mouth and even a moustache.

Figure 5.13: Puppet made of discarded cardboard; eyes, nose, mouth, ears and hair cutout of cardboard and pasted on the body. Multiple broomsticks taped together and inserted into the cardboard section of the puppet to make it move.

Painting the face

There are various ways in which you can finalise your puppet head. You must imagine a combination of eyes, nose, lips and ears that express the emotion (Figure 5.16). For example, smiling face, frowning face, laughing face, and so on.

Once you decide the expression, paste paper on the head- you can use paper tape to do this. Draw the expressions of the puppets on the paper tape. Draw/paste a photo of the puppet head in the box.

It is not necessary to paint the skin colour exactly the same as our skin colour. As a puppet is an imaginary character, the colours can also be imaginary. You can use different colours to paint the face.

Making the body

There are different ways in which a puppet’s body can be built. Figure 5.17 shows one way to make a human puppet.

You can also make a shirt and long skirt or pants and attach it to the puppet if

you wish.

Step 4 You can draw hands on a piece of cardboard on the paper. Then you can cut the cardboard appropriately. Attach the hands to the sleeves of the puppet’s dress.

Now have fun with your puppets.

## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 128 18-03-2025 4.27.22 PM.

How will you make your puppet move?

According to the script, you may need to change the expression on the puppet’s face (e.g., smiling face, frowning face, sad face) or the way its body is positioned (e.g., standing tiger, lying down tiger). This is possible by making more than one puppet for each character with different expressions and positions.

Finalising your puppets

You have experimented with various puppets. Now, start working towards making the puppets for your show.

Please fill table 5.4 as this will help you plan your puppets. An example is given in the table to help you add details about your

Did you get the puppets right the first time or did you need to make any improvement in the puppets/remake any puppet? If yes, explain why and what you did.

Now you are ready to prepare for the show. Activity 7: Puppet show

Start rehearsing with the puppets. Make sure everyone is clear about their responsibilities to ensure a great show. Some of you can be puppeteers, others can give light and sound effects, and can change the backdrop as the scenes change. There might be other things that need to be done based on your story.

It is extremely important to have the following elements to have a great puppet show:


## a. Stage

The space where the show is performed, is very important. First, there must be scope to create a ‘stage’ so that the audience can clearly see the puppets. Second, there must be space for the audience to sit. There are different ways to set a stage (Figures 5.21 to 5.23).

Figure 5.21: A bedsheet covering a table is used as a stage. The bedsheet will hide the puppeteer, who can move the puppets using their hands or sticks attached to the puppets’ bodies.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 130 18-03-2025 4.27.23 PM

Figure 5.22: A bedsheet can also Figure 5.23: A frame used as a stage for a puppet be used as a curtain to cover the show. The frame should ideally be a rectangle (just

puppeteer. In case the puppeteer uses like watching a film in the theatre). It can be made strings, the sheet can be tied toastring with different materials, but take care that the size

behind the table like a curtain. of the ‘window’ is large enough for the puppets and

their movement to be clearly visible.

Remember, you need to keep the puppets which you will use for the show, close to the stage where the audience cannot see them. For example, you can keep the puppets behind the cloth used to cover the table.

Where will you do the puppet show?


## Backdrop

The backdrop is very important since it shows the setting of the story. The setting may changeas the story progresses : from one scene _ Figure 5.24: Background showing a jungle with animals to the next, and therefore, the backdrop may change. You can draw or paint these different settings on a chart paper


## Storytime with Puppets


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 131

18-03-2025 4.27.23 PM.

or an old bedsheet (Figure 5.24). As the scene changes, the backdrop changes as well. You can even draw the backdrops on a curtain and slide them using hooks or hoops.

Briefly describe the backdrop(s) you have prepared.


## Props

The kind of props will depend on how they are to be used. For example, we can use thick cardboard to create a chair, bed, or a throne, and so on.


## However, if the yu .

Props can be made using simple materials, such as paper (e.g., newspaper, chapati), aluminium (e.g., sword, knife), cardboard or disposable containers (e.g., gas stove, plates) (Figure 5.25).

Briefly describe the props you have prepared.


## Voice

Voice modulation plays an extremely powerful role in puppetry; the puppeteer acts through her or his voice. You must assign distinct voices to each puppet to differentiate the characters. For example, a lion puppet could have a deep, commanding voice, while a rabbit could have a high- pitched, playful voice.

To make sure the audience understands what you are saying, speak clearly and loudly. Practice showing emotions, like happiness, fear, or excitement using voice


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 132

18-03-2025 4.27.23 PM.

modulation. For example, sound fearful during a chase scene, or whisper during a suspenseful moment.

Refer the script you wrote. Try to do voice acting with puppets for dialogues. Practice playing sound or singing together wherever required. Practice is key for the success of your efforts.


## Sound and music

You should have different types of sounds in the puppet show depending on the script —- background music or sounds effects, like thundering of clouds before rain. You can use musical instruments or create sounds by tapping on the floor or the desk using a pencil, scale or your fingers. You can tap on a glass or bottle with different levels of water to create music for your show. You can experiment with different sound effect using the sound system; for example, whistling into a microphone creates the sound of the wind (Figure 5.26).


## Figure 5.26: Making music

Refer to your script (Table 5.3) to decide the music and sound effects and how you will generate them.

You can search for music online using the keywords: exciting + celebration + music + no copyright


## f. Light

Light is needed in puppetry both to ensure the audience can see the puppets and for effects. If the show is outdoor


## Storytime with Puppets


## Ch-5 Storytime with Puppets.indd 133

18-03-2025 4.27.23 PM

in the daytime, light does not play a role. However, if the show is in a dark space, you need to plan the placement of lights. For example, you can use a torch behind curtains to show the moon, sun or a magic lamp. You can also use fairy lights, table lamps, earthen pots (diya), etc.

Refer to your script (Table 5.3) to decide lighting effects and how you will generate them.


## Puppeteer

The puppeteer needs to rehearse the dialogues well. Remember, the puppet is speaking, not you. You should also know when the puppet will enter the stage— ‘in’ and when to exit the stage — ‘out’.

Secondly, the puppeteer should look at the puppet while the puppet talks to the audience. This means that as a puppeteer your face needs to be flat without emotions, so that the audience looks at the puppet and not at you.

Activity 8: Putting up a puppet show

Now, it is time for the show. Do not forget to take a look at the checklist in table 5.5 before the show:

Family health refers to the overall physical, mental, and emotional well-being of all members within a family. The health of individuals and the family as a whole are interconnected with each other.

Good health results from many factors, including diet, physical fitness, sleep, mental well-being, and environmental factors (Figure 6.1). While all these factors are important for people of different ages, the needs of people from various age groups are different. This project is about understanding the needs of different members of the family and creating a family health handbook.

You have learnt about the importance of health both in school, and from family and friends. You are also aware that good health, a positive attitude and mental well-being are very important for your happiness. You may have been practicing Yoga and found that it helps you not only to be physically fit but also to be calm and energised throughout the day. You become more flexible and stronger while being able to concentrate on whatever you are doing.

You have also learnt that a nutritious and well-balanced diet is necessary to meet the body’s needs. Different components of food are necessary to fulfil different needs of the body, and give us energy to work and play.

In addition to this, rest is very important. Our body repairs itself when we sleep, and we wake up refreshed and ready for another day. Depending on age, sleeping for a certain number of hours daily is, therefore, very important for health.

Positive attitude and mental well-being are equally important. A well-balanced diet, regular exercise, personal hygiene, positive thoughts, and kindness are important for mental well-being. Along with these, it is important to do things you enjoy and to spend time with loved ones.

Still, despite all these efforts, people fall ill due to various reasons, including environmental factors. Therefore, you need to take care to protect yourself and your family. For example, timely vaccination, taking precautions to prevent spread of infections, keeping the surroundings clean, and ensuring there is no stagnant

## Ch-6 Famly Health Handbook.indd 139 18-03-2025 4.28.52 PM.

water where mosquitoes can breed. Knowing whom to ask for help and when to see the doctor is also important.

Thus, essential factors for assuring health are —- well-balanced and nutritious diet, physical fitness, sleep, positive attitude and mental well-being, and environmental factors.

In this project, you will learn more about these factors and what can be done to maintain your health and that of your family. You will develop and maintain records and write your action plan in the family health handbook.

io, By the end of this project, you will be able to: 1. Identify the specific needs of individuals of different age groups. 2. Respond to any health issue in the family. 3. Create a first-aid kit for use in school and at home. 4. Develop a plan to support good health and well-being in the family.

What willIneed?

1. Notebook/sheets and binder for the handbook and stationery

2. First-aid materials (small bandages, cotton balls or swabs, medical tape, hand sanitiser/disinfectant, masks and gloves, antiseptic ointments, basic medicines as per advice of doctor, salt, sugar, ORS, thermometer, tweezers, scissors, safety pins, and others as per the advice of the expert).

1. You must follow all safety instructions, and use tools and equipment as directed.

## Ch-6 Famly Health Handbook.indd 140 18-03-2025 4.28.52 PM.

During visits to the hospital/ Primary Health Centre (PHC)/ Community Health Centre (CHC), maintain your distance and wear a mask to protect yourself and the patients. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly after the visit. Dispose of used gloves, masks and bandages as directed by the expert and/or your Teacher to prevent the spread of infection. Be sensitive and empathetic to the injured, young children and the old. Accept diversity—do not judge people by body shapes, sizes, or food habits.

Internet safety: Ask your teacher for help while using

oa x, the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download

anything without checking. Do not share personal information anywhere.

as What do I need to know before I start?

You know some of the common factors affecting health. Discuss the factors affecting health with others in your group, your parents and teachers.


## Activity 1: Factors Affecting Health

Some factors that affect our health are given below. Please give examples of how they impact us. Add any factors that you feel are important:

Which factors can you do something about, and which are out


## of your control?

Did you know?

These are some recommendations by health experts.


## Diet and Nutrition

1.

2.

&,

Meal Frequency: Eating three main meals and 1-2 healthy snacks at consistent intervals prevents overeating or dips in energy. Hydration: Drinking at least 6-8 glasses of water daily is essential for digestion, temperature regulation, and mental focus.

Eat home cooked food and limit eating processed food: Even a ‘simple meal’ like dal fry and rice ordered from outside may not be healthy since you are unsure of the amount of oil added or whether the dal is freshly cooked or stale. Therefore, limiting food ordered from outside, processed snacks (e.g., chips), sugary drinks, and fried foods is good for health.


## Sleep Pattern

1.

Sleep duration varies by age. Ideally, about 9-11 hours of sleep is ideal for students aged 6-13, while about 8-9 hours of sleep is sufficient for adults. Children below the age of 5 require more than 11 hours of sleep.

. Healthy body functioning is also determined by a regular sleep

schedule (going to bed and waking up at the same time daily); this helps regulate the body’s internal clock.


## . Disruptions like noise, bright lights, or uncomfortable bedding

can affect sleep patterns.

. To go to sleep easily, avoid stimulating activities, like screen time,


## loud music, or heavy meals an hour before sleep.


## Physical Fitness

1.

2.

Lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle can have a very harmful effect on body functions in the long run.

Consistency is key, so you should choose a physical activity that you like. It can be yoga, sports or a simple walk.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7

18-03-2025 4.28.52 PM.


## Mental Well-being

Just as our physical well-being can be affected by many factors, our mental well-being is also prone to being affected. For example, due to a fight with a friend, examination stress, concerns about family, or any other reason. Mental and physical well-being are interconnected, and both are equally important. Spending time with friends and family, and on productive activities, including games and sports, helps maintain mental well-being.

You have identified factors that affect health and may have noted some questions. As you continue to work on your project, you will try and find answers to these questions. You will understand the needs of persons of different age groups and identify environmental factors around you that may affect health. You will also learn how to provide first-aid, and how to avail medical care. Finally, you will come up with an action plan to improve and maintain your and your family’s health. All this will be part of your family health handbook.

You can learn more about family health and first-aid techniques by searching on the Internet.

You can search using keywords, like family health, basic first-aid and steps, tips for family health and wellness, first-aid for common injuries, etc.

Activity 2: Framing questions related to your and your family’s health

Think about your and your family members’ health. What questions come to your mind?

Write these questions or even any relevant thoughts in your handbook. Some examples are given on the next page. Add to these sample questions —- do remember to leave space for answers.


## Family Health Handbook


## Ch-6 Famly Health Handbook.indd 143 18-03-2025 4.28.52 PM.

1. My younger sister is 4 years old. Why does she catch a cold so often?

2. What can I do if someone at home gets a fever?

3. My parents often say, “Don’t watch TV before sleeping”. Why is that so?

4. Why does my grandmother refuse to eat?

The answers to some of these questions may be available with family members, other community members and teachers. But you may have to speak to experts, like doctors, nurses, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA workers), and Anganwadi teachers/ workers to get answers to others. You may also be able to answer some of these questions yourself as you take up the different activities in the project.


## Activity 3: Visit_to a hospital/Primary Health Centre (PHC)/ Community Health Centre (CHC)

Visiting a hospital/PHC/CHC will help you develop a deeper understanding of health-related factors. You will be able to observe a day in the life of a health expert. Observe them, how they treat a patient, what equipment they use, and how the comfort of patients is taken care of (Figure 6.2).

Request the experts you meet to demonstrate the use of the first-aid Figure 6.2: Interaction with healthcare professionals


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-6 Famly Health Handbook.indd 144 18-03-2025 4.28.52 PM

kit, and to help you put together a list of materials and medicines to keep in the kit. Also, gather helpful information that could help you in the future (e.g., emergency numbers, number for ambulance).

In addition to the questions you have already identified, examples of specific questions to ask the doctors and nurses you meet are given. Add other questions that come to your mind.

Remember, even if some other questions come up during the project, you can request permission from the expert(s) to connect with them later.

For your health handbook: Write down the following information after you visit the hospital.

1. What are the different facilities available in your centre?

2. What services are provided to patients (e.g., vaccination, outpatient treatment, diagnosis, in-hospital treatment, and specialised treatments)?

3. What are the most common illnesses in our area? How can we prevent them?


## Family Health Handbook


## Ch-6 Famly Health Handbook.indd 145 18-03-2025 4.28.52 PM.

4. What should we do in an emergency? What should we do if an accident happens?

5. What are the fees charged to the patient? How is billing done? How is the payment to be done? Are there any concessions given (e.g., for senior citizens and military personnel)?

6. How do we decide if someone needs medical help or we can manage at home?

7. What should we do if someone falls sick during the night or on a holiday?

Activity 4: Creating a first-aid kit

Once you have observed and understood the use of the first-aid kit at the centre, you can create it on your own in school.

In our daily lives, we often experience minor cuts, accidents, wounds, and minor illness. A first-aid kit can provide medical assistance. It is equipped with basic medicines for emergencies. You should also have a first-aid kit at home as a part of your safety readiness plan.

The first-aid activities you could focus on are:

1. Tying bandages for minor cuts (Figure 6.3).

2. First-aid for minor burns (Figure 6.4).

3. Preparing ORS during dehydration (Figure 6.5).

Remember, first-aid is only emergency treatment before you take the patient to the doctor.


## Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7


## Ch-6 Famly Health Handbook.indd 146 18-03-2025 4.28.52 PM.

You can organise a workshop in school to create a first-aid kit. The workshop must be conducted by an expert, who could either be a health professional or a teacher or parent.

## Content of the Workshop

1. Discussion on the importance ofa first-aid kit to treat basic ailments.

2. Exploring components of the first-aid kit: Decide the contents that can be incorporated into the school first-aid kit. Brainstorm on possible injuries and health issues which might occur on school premises and what components will be required.

3. Organising and labelling the components of the first-aid kit.

4. Making the first-aid kit: The components you have selected must be placed in a wide metal container or a small bag with pockets. You may make separators using cardboard or place the components in smaller boxes or bags to ensure you can find them easily, if needed. The box or bag must have the label ‘first-aid kit’.

5. Demonstration and practice of use: Make notes while experts demonstrate basic procedures, such as applying bandages for cuts, treating minor burns, dehydration, fever, etc.


## Practice once with the support of the expert.

6. Deciding where to place the first-aid kit: The first-aid kit should be kept in an easily accessible place on the school premises, but out of reach of the younger students.

Figure 6.6 shows the components of the first-aid kit. What else do you think could be required?

Activity 5: Factors affecting health at different ages

People have different needs at different ages. You may have noticed that babies eat and sleep a lot, and elderly people like to rest in the afternoon. To identify specific needs of your family members, you must understand the factors affecting health at different ages.

Each family is different, e.g., some families have parents and one or more children, some are joint families with many generations living in the same house, some are only made up of one parent and a child - many variations are possible. However, most of us will have people of all ages in our extended families, or family friends of different ages.

With this in mind, collect and document basic health data and some observations related to daily routine for the following age groups: (i) Below 5 years, (ii) 6-18 years, (iii) 19-30 years, (iv) 31-45 years, (v) 46-60 years, (vi) above 60 years. Even if you do not have a family member from any of these age groups, you can collect information from a relative/neighbour/friend. You can make separate sections for every age group using 3-4 sheets, or as required, for each member in your handbook.

Few examples of questions you can ask are given in table 6.1. Add to these questions as per your need.

All questions may not be relevant for particular persons; you may skip those. For children in the age group under 5 years, fill the information after speaking to their parents.

Using tablet/smartphone to collect data on pollution

Noise is measured in decibels (db). Sound above 85 db is considered harmful for humans.

You can measure noise pollution using apps on a tablet/smartphone. Search with the keywords: noise measuring app You can also find the Air Quality Index (AQI) at your geotag location on

the MAUSAM website of the Environmental Monitoring Service managed by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

You now have data from the survey of family members, as

well as your observations of your environment. Analysing this

data will help you develop an action plan for improving and

maintaining your and your family’s health.

to ensure that it is safe to drink; this can protect your family from harmful illnesses.

It is very easy to test if water is potable. The H2S Strip Test Kit is a simple method used to check for bacterial contamination in water.

Using HS strip test kit

1. Pour the water sample into the bottle up to the given mark (20 ml).

2. Cap the bottle and mix well. The colour of the water will change to golden brown.

3. Keep this bottle at room temperature (about 25-35°C ). In case of low temperatures, the bottle should be wrapped in a warm cloth and kept in a warm place.

4. Do not disturb the bottle for 24-28 hours.

5. Now observe the colour of the sample (Figure 6.7).

Interpreting test

1. If the colour does not change and remains golden brown: Water is safe for drinking.

2. If the colour turns black: Water is contaminated with harmful bacteria and is not safe for drinking.

When you do the analysis, keep in mind the specific needs of elders (e.g., lack of sleep due to noise pollution), babies (e.g., special type of food preparation), and of persons with disabilities (Divyang).

Activity 7: Making a plan to improve your and family’s health

You noted the absence and presence of certain things in the environment. Identify what actions are needed to be taken, and who needs to take the action. For example, what can you do to eliminate mosquitoes in surrounding areas - will you start a cleanliness drive? Or take support from elders to raise the issue to the relevant municipal authority?

1. According to you, what were the two most important things you learnt during the visit to the health centre and from interaction with health professionals?

2. Often, we are well aware of what we have to do and yet we do not practise it. For example, we all know exercise is important, but we often skip it. What do you think is the reason for this? What can be done to change this?

What did I do and how long did it take?

It is important to understand how much time is required for an activity to be completed.

You have worked on your projects and are now ready to share what you did and how you did it with others.

You may have shared something with other students and teachers during classroom presentations or during school assembly. You can also invite your family and other people to come and see your work. You can do this through the Kaushal Mela. But first, you must plan each detail carefully.

Planning is important since it helps you decide how to reach your goal. You must think about what need to be done and when it needs to be done so that everything goes smoothly. For example, if you are putting up a puppet show, you need to decide when and where keeping in mind that the maximum number of people watch it. Planning also helps to prevent wastage of time and resources. For example, if you want to demonstrate the tie and dye process, you must ensure all the materials are available in one place in the right quantity.

Since the Kaushal Mela will involve a lot of planning and coordination, you must plan each detail carefully. Responsibilities must be assigned for each activity, and the process for each activity discussed in detail. You must also develop a plan to work together as a team.

Table 7.1 below will help you plan for the Kaushal Mela. Do add more details based on your discussions.

Achievable and measurable objectives aligned with the curricular goal, competencies and grade-wise learning outcomes have to be defined for each project. Activities must be designed for the fulfilment of these objectives. Define two or three simple objectives in words that students can understand. These objectives indicate what students will be able to do at the end of the project. Students must be able to respond to the following questions: 1. What will you be able to do by the end of the project? 2. What will you learn?

What will I need?

Ensure that the required resources are accessible and locally available, and help students identify what is required for the project. Students must be able to: 1. Provide a brief overview of the tools, equipment, materials, and other resources needed for the project.

This section should include all the safety precautions to be taken during the project, including Internet safety measures. Students should also wear appropriate clothing, such as long sleeves, pants, and sturdy shoes, while doing activities in the field.

Safety precautions related to tools, materials, equipment, and internet use must be explained and demonstrated. Students must be able to respond to the following questions:

1. Howwill you ensure your safety and that of others during the project?

2. What will you do to ensure no one is physically or emotionally hurt?

3. How will you ensure the safety of plants and animals, if relevant?

4. How will you maintain confidentiality (that is, you will not share

information about anyone without checking with them first)?

5. What will you do to keep yourself safe on the Internet?


## Annexure 1

Ch-8 Annexures.indd 165 18-03-2025 4.33.47 PM.

(4 What do I need to know before I start?

Prepare students to begin work by recalling prior knowledge, introducing concepts through activities that require them to work with tools and materials, exploring the environment and basic skills related to the project, and so on. Clearly define roles and responsibilities for all participants, and ensure everyone understands their tasks and how they contribute to the project. Students must be able to respond to the following questions: 1. Is there anything you need to learn before starting your project? 2. Do you need to meet an expert who can teach you how to do the activities related to the project? 3. Is there anything in your locality that you need to find out about? 4. Do you need to conduct a survey, take up field visits, or something similar before you start?

Students need to take up various activities required for the completion of the project. Frame questions that will help them to think about what is to be done, and subsequently, record data or information related to the project. Students must be able to do the following: 1. Follow the project plan and execute tasks according to the timelines. 2. Observe others to learn practical skills and techniques, such as proper tool usage, effective planting methods, and maintenance practices. 3. Monitor progress regularly and adjust as necessary. 4. Keeprecords ofall activities and challenges faced during the activities. 5. Document what they have learnt, their successes and challenges for future reference. As they complete each activity, students can be asked the following: 1. The materials you used and how you used them. 2. The tools you used and how you used them. 3. The process you followed, such as the selection of materials/tools, sequence of tasks, and how you completed each one. 4. Ifyou collected information/data/objects, describe them and explain why they are useful. If you made something, include a photograph or a sketch. If you grew a plant, record its growth. What safety precautions did you take while doing the activities? Did you use any AI tool? If yes, which ones did you use and how did you use them? 9. Did you share the outcome of your project with others outside the school? Describe your plan and how you executed it. 10. Did you do something to keep the environment clean or to recycle waste? Record the details.

Learning from others is a crucial aspect of any project. Therefore, students should reflect on what they have learnt from others. It can help improve their soft skills, deepen their understanding, and enhance the project’s overall success.

Engaging with others enables students to communicate effectively, share ideas, and collaborate on tasks. Diverse perspectives and ideas are introduced, which help students learn from the viewpoints of others. This can help them approach problems in new ways, and enhance their creativity and problem- solving skills. Listening to others, such as workers in the world of work, experts, professionals, and the like provides valuable insights that can help improve learner’s practices.

Students must be able to identify what they learnt during field trips, online and offline interactions with experts, from family and friends, community members, and other sources. They must be able to respond to the following

questions: 1. What did you learn from field trips, interactions, video lectures, or experts? 2. What did you learn from your friends? Did you help them with something? 3. What did you learn from family members, siblings, and community elders?

4. What did you learn from people in the community?

What did I do and how long did it take?

In order to develop the capacity for time-based planning, students must record the entire process followed, the sequence of activities, and the time taken for each activity. This can be done as they proceed or at the end of the project. Students must be able to respond or think back on what they did and how long it took them to plan and execute the activities.


## Ori Ma What else can I do?

Students need to think of other setting, in which they can apply their learning from the projects, especially outside the school. For example, students can participate in workshops, coding classes, and exhibitions or fairs. They can


## Annexure 1

Ch-8 Annexures.indd 167 18-03-2025 4.33.47 PM.

also apply their learnings from the projects at home, and in various other places. They can celebrate cultural heritage months, international days, or multicultural festivals, and organise cultural events, culinary events, skill exhibitions, etc. They can integrate subjects through interdisciplinary projects, like historical re-enactments, science and art collaborations, or literary functions through performances.

Students must be able to respond to the following questions:

1. What else can you do to apply your learning from the project?

2. Do you see any scope to expand the current project? How?

Students must reflect on what they have learned from their recent experiences. A set of questions must be designed to assess learning of key aspects of the project and related concepts across curricular areas.

Some of the questions that can be asked include the following:

1. What did you enjoy doing? What were the challenges you faced? Question(s) related to the project itself. What are some examples of jobs related to the activities you just did? What other jobs are related to the project?

2. 3. 4.


## Planning

Since planning is animportant part ofall work, all projects contain components of planning. However, to ensure students are able to detail out the steps required in planning, the planning section can be used as it is given in the Activity Book. In case the school plans an alternative approach to meet this outcome, it must be ensured that students are able to respond to the following questions:

1. What is the final event you are planning? When and where will it be held? Who will be the invitees? What will the final event involve? What are the steps required to ensure the final event goes as per the plan, and when do they have to be fulfilled? What are the resources involved and who will be responsible for each step?

## Time Allocation and Mapping of Learning Outcomes

The tables given ahead indicate Time Allocation and Mapping of Learning Outcomes for the activities included in the projects for Grade 7.

Time Allocation: The time allocated for each activity is a suggestion, and teachers can adjust it based on their class size and complexity of the project.

Cross-curricular Connections: The projects can be drawn from other subjects in the Middle Stage—Language, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Art Education, and Physical Education and Well-being. This allows for a more holistic learning experience. Connection to other curricular areas is also indicated in the upcoming tables.

Student Reflection: Reflection prompts are included (“What did I learn?”, “What else can I do?”) to encourage students to think critically about their work.

Safety: The tables emphasise safety precautions (LO 6) for activities involving tools or potential hazards.

Open-ended Learning: The “What else can I do?” section (LO 16) encourages students to explore connect to home and extend their learning.

Learning Outcomes: Each project focuses on developing specific skills and knowledge (LO 1-9) along with essential values related to work (LO 10-15).

Please note that LO 10 to LO 15, which refer to the essential values while working across areas, are applicable across all activities.
