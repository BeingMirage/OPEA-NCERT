The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pafichakoshas, in the foundational and the preparatory stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the middle stage.

One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks.", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}

Its content comprises projects related to three work forms—life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}

For example, you need to water the plants, ensure there is no stagnant water to prevent mosquitoes, clear fallen leaves and stems from pathways (you can collect them and put them in a compost bed). Therefore, you must prepare a maintenance schedule for the habitat garden. You can divide yourselves into small teams and distribute the work. You must rotate the tasks so that everybody gets a chance to contribute. You can prepare a maintenance chart and keep a checklist to ensure tasks are done on time.
