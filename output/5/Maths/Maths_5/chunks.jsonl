It rather pushes learners to explore and discover important mathematical ideas. The sections named ‘Let Us Think’, ‘Let Us Explore’, and ‘Let Us Discuss’, included at various places, aim at keeping learners curious to reason out their thinking. These will give them reasons and insights that can be used to remember ideas and apply ideas flexibly and creatively, making further learning easier. It is important to engage with these processes of Mathematics so that learners can go beyond routine mathematical problems confidently and without fear and anxiety. We hope that the carefully chosen learning activities will help them make sense of the ideas, develop capacities to solve problems, experience wonder and joy in the process, and be curious about the world of mathematics.

The need for these different strategies arises depending on the numbers used. If the numbers are 250, 500, 750 or even 200, 400, 500, etc., we can add and subtract numbers orally. In fact, we should encourage these mental strategies to be able to use mathematics for daily life problem-solving. When numbers are not amenable to such oral calculations, the learners can choose one of the column strategies provided here, based on their comfort. Help learners observe the similarity between subtraction of numbers and subtraction of quantities like weights.", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}
