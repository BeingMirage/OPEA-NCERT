## Foreword

The Foundational Stage in school education, as envisaged by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the holistic development of children. It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage.

The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the Middle Stages, spanning three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way, discovery, and activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and more formal classroom settings. This introduction aims not to overwhelm but to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive, sensitive, physical, and pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage.

The textbook, Maths Mela for Grade 5 Mathematics is meticulously designed to align with these objectives. It adheres to the recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023. The textbook emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, values, and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness integrating appropriate ICT and school-based assessments. The engaging content and activities are designed to captivate students and encourage peer group learning, thus enriching the educational experience for students as well as teachers.


## iv

It is crucial to remember the pedagogical focus of the textbook emphasising understanding, critical thinking, reasoning, and decision making. Children’s innate curiosity at this stage should be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on core learning principles. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather than mere attraction.

While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours.

An effective learning environment motivates students, keeping them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder vital for learning.

With confidence, I recommend this textbook to all students and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content.

## About) the) Book’

The textbook Maths Mela for Grade 5, has been developed based on the recent documents—National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. They aim to ensure that all children achieve basic numerical skills and abilities to think mathematically and logically, solve problems, develop intuitions regarding quantities and reasoning, and feel a sense of joy, wonder, and curiosity. The Preparatory Stage specifically focuses on the development of conceptual ideas about numbers, shapes, and spatial relationships, measurement and data handling, procedural skills and fluency, and computational thinking.

In light of this, the book for Grade 5 is designed to support learners in consolidating their learnings in the Foundational Stage and making progress towards dealing with more abstract ideas. The chapters of the book cover the foundational ideas of Mathematics: whole numbers and operations, fractions, shapes and spatial relationships, measurement (length, weight, capacity, time), and data handling. Chapters are woven around certain themes so as to engage children with the ideas and their applications. Ideas will keep recurring throughout the book, building deeper engagement and complexity to suit the interest and curiosity of the growing child.

We firmly believe that young learners are capable of reasoning, thinking, and problem-solving in different ways. Therefore, the book provides several occasions for identifying and noticing ideas and relationships across ideas, giving examples and counter-examples to statements, creating objects using mathematical ideas, measuring and quantifying, estimating, and solving problems. There are also opportunities to hone one’s arithmetic skills through bare exercises, games, and puzzles. At some places in the chapters, such opportunities have been provided under the section ‘Let us Play’. Another important purpose behind games and puzzles is to provide learners a stress-free and joyful learning. Most of these need not be assessed. Some tasks are aimed towards ‘computational thinking’ where learners are expected to observe and articulate patterns and find exhaustive solutions and solutions under different constraints.


## vi

We also believe that learners should develop a liking for Mathematics. The chapters of this textbook provide several enjoyable activities, tasks, games, and puzzles that build on children’s intuitions and tap into their experiences in the world around them. These have been given under the section ‘Let Us Do’ at many places in the chapters. These are sometimes used for making an entry to the concept and at other times provide opportunities to consolidate the ideas. The narrative in the chapters is supported through vivid illustrations, which are also integral to the tasks. We hope that this will allow learners to read pictures and use them for developing important mathematical ideas. Mathematical vocabulary and ways of communicating about mathematics have been emphsised throughout the chapters. We continue to provide instructions and explanation with as little use of language as possible.

Mathematics is an integrated body of knowledge, with a connected and coherent set of ideas. It can be built logically on commonly shared assumptions. Mathematical thinking and reasoning are an important part of learning mathematics. The book attempts to move away from rote memorisation of rules and procedures which kill learners’ curiosity and burden them. It rather pushes learners to explore and discover important mathematical ideas. The sections named ‘Let Us Think’, ‘Let Us Explore’, and ‘Let Us Discuss’, included at various places, aim at keeping learners curious to reason out their thinking. These will give them reasons and insights that can be used to remember ideas and apply ideas flexibly and creatively, making further learning easier. It is important to engage with these processes of Mathematics so that learners can go beyond routine mathematical problems confidently and without fear and anxiety. We hope that the carefully chosen learning activities will help them make sense of the ideas, develop capacities to solve problems, experience wonder and joy in the process, and be curious about the world of mathematics. In addition to all of these, with growing capacities of children we have introduced a section called “Let Us Solve”. This is aimed to help children hone their skills of using procedures, solving routine problems, and word problems.

We believe that the time available for children to work on problems and share their solutions and ideas will be crucial to achieve the objectives of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023. The book carries several suggestions for appropriate activities and experiences (in class and in and around the home) to develop mathematical ideas.

Teachers’ and parents’ support in changing conditions of learning for our children will be very important to achieve the dreams of a better and more confident nation.

The book also advises on the making of simple inexpensive concrete materials for learners to work with, and to develop and communicate their thinking. A few perforated sheets for some of the tasks in the chapters are provided at the end of the book. There are some more ideas in the ‘Note for the Teachers’ for activities and materials. The chapters also show a gradual movement from the use of materials to the use of pictures and making schematic diagrams to make sense of the situation and identify better strategy. The book tries to build models for the ideas using materials and pictures so that learners can use them to develop independent thinking. We would sincerely urge teachers and parents to use the sequence of ideas suggested in the book for teaching and gradually arrive at more formal rules and procedures. When children develop a better understanding, they will be in a better position to appreciate the rules and procedures. Similar care is also to be taken by parents and elder siblings who may help their wards in learning through this book. ‘Note for the Teachers’ may help teachers and parents in appropriately enhancing the child’s learning.

Several activities and tasks in the book also require that children talk and discuss their ideas. Learning will significantly improve in a classroom that welcomes and respects learners’ ideas. They will see different ways of thinking and using ideas, and alternative solutions leading to better and independent solutions over a period of time. They will get opportunities to scrutinise each other’s solutions and develop fluency with mathematical language, symbols, and procedures. These will also serve as good assessments of learning for the teacher and also provide feedback to them. The exercises given in the book are also examples of how learners can be assessed.

Assessment should be done in multiple forms—using materials and pictures, problem situations and bare problems, activities, creating objects, and sharing and explaining solutions. The book provides enough opportunities for adaptive assessment, assessment for learning, and assessment as learning while the child is engaged in different activities. Teachers can note down their observations while the learners discuss their ideas, replying to the questions asked, and explaining the reasoning for their answer. Such records can be included in the learner’s portfolio.


## vit

Chapters have more paper and pen tasks in Grade 5 (questions, word problems, and projects) that a child can complete in the classroom or at home. Such tasks provide opportunities to practice writing and present their thinking on paper.

In the times to come, we will provide more resources to the teachers and learners in the form of videos, worksheets for practice, and links to online resources.

We hope that the book will be enjoyable to all and will lead to better teaching-learning conditions.

## Gandhiji’s Talisman

I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test:

Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to Swaraj for the hungry and spiritually starving millions ?

Then you will find your doubts and your self melting away.

When was the last time you went on a long trip? Where did you go? How did you travel? What was the duration of your trip? How much distance did you cover? Ask the elders who went with you to help you answer these questions.

Human beings have always been interested in travelling. About a hundred years ago, there were far fewer vehicles than today. There were animal-drawn carts, cars, and trains. Long before this, thousands of years ago, people travelled long distances on foot or used animals to travel from one place to another. They also built boats and ships to travel across lakes, rivers, and seas. Boats were

probably the first form of transport invented by humans, much before bullock

carts! Do you know how many vehicles are currently there in your state?

We learnt that people in the past travelled on foot, on animals, and used boats and sailing ships. The animals that have been used for travelling include bullocks, horses, donkeys, mules, and elephants. In hilly and snow-covered regions, yaks, dogs, and reindeers have been used, while camels have been used in deserts.

Now, people use bicycles, motorbikes, cars, buses, trains, ships, and aeroplanes to travel from one place to another. Submarines are used to go deep under water. Humans are also using spacecraft to travel to outer space.

## Finding Large Numbers Around Us

We saw that the distance (in kilometre) covered by different means of transport in an hour can range from a 1-digit number to a 5-digit number. Can we find other contexts around us that contain numbers in this range? Let us consider the situation below.

A book has around 200 pages, and each page has about 50 words. The book therefore has about 10,000 words in all.

Find something in the textbook whose count is a 4-digit number.

Now, let us try this with our school.

(a) Our school has classrooms. (b) There are students in my class. (c) Our classroom has books in total.

Usually, we measure distances in sea and air using nautical miles. For now, we will use 1 km = 1,000 m. By now, you know different units of measuring length. We will study the units for measuring length, kilometre, in detail in a later chapter.

with him. He can take one of them at a time. If the sheep and grass are left on the shore, the sheep will eat the grass. And, if the sheep and lion are left on the shore, the lion will eat the sheep.

How can the boatman take the lion, sheep, and grass across the river?

Help him so that he can ferry the lion, sheep, and grass across the river safely, and in the minimum number of trips.

2. Sanju introduces a game called pile of pebbles to Mira.

There are two piles of pebbles. Each pile contains 7 pebbles. Each player can pick as many pebbles they want from either of the piles. The player who picks the last pebble wins.

Try this game with your friends. Now, how do you play so that you win?

To find a winning strategy, try playing with 1 pebble in each pile, two in each, three in each, and so on.

3. Now, it’s Mira’s turn. She gives a fun puzzle to Sanju with the following steps— For example (a) Take any two different digits. ._——-+>3 and 7

(b) Make two 2-digit numbers ——————_337 and 73 using them.

(c) Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.

Now, use the two digits in the difference and repeat steps (b) and (c).

——— 73 - 37 = 36

Continue this process until you get a 1-digit number. Even before everyone could finish, Mira exclaimed, “Mind you! No matter which two numbers you choose, you will get 9 in the end.”

The whole process will look as shown below.

73 63 72 54 -—37 7 - 36 > -27 7-45 36 27 45 9

How did Mira know what the 1-digit number in the end would be? Let us explore. (1) Observe the differences you get in each step above. Do you notice anything in common? (2) Try the puzzle using any other pair of digits. What is common to these differences? What do you get in the end?

(3) What digits can you choose so that you get a 1-digit number in the first step itself? Give some examples. Describe the pattern in the digits.

Note for Teachers: Encourage the students to think logically and strategically while solving these puzzles. Such thinking underlies all of mathematics.


## | Chapter-1 We the Travellers-l.indd 12 7/2/2025 3:29:59 PM

(4) Now, find different digits such that the difference between the numbers is 27.

(5) Mira found an interesting relationship between the two digits and the difference obtained. Can you see it in the table that Mira made?

73 - 37 = 36

91-19=72 82 - 28 = 54 54-45 =9

Extend this table by choosing appropriate digits so that the resulting differences are 2, 3, 5, and 7 respectively.

What do the differences between the digits indicate?

List the numbers that give a 1-digit number in the third subtraction.

Identify pairs of digits that lead to the 1-digit number after the maximum possible number of subtractions. Compare your answers with your friends.

| King’s Horses Once upon a time, there was a king who was very fond of horses. He had 20 horses of the

best breed. The horses were kept in the royal stable, and cared for by a caretaker.

One night, a thief stole one of the horses. Fearing punishment, the caretaker arranged the horses in the stable as shown in the picture here.

The next day, when the king came to check on the horses, the caretaker led him around the square stable. “Please count the number of horses along each side, your majesty,” he said.

The dots above show how the horses were arranged in the stable.

Chapter 1.indd 15 05-07-2025 15:01:04 |

The king counted 5 horses along each side. “We have 5 horses along each side and there are 4 sides. So there are a total of 20 horses, your majesty,” the caretaker explained.

Satisfied with the explanation, the king returned to his palace.

But wait, were there really 20 horses in the stable? Count the horses one by one and check! What was the mistake in the caretaker’s explanation?

The following night, the thief stole another horse from the stable. Now, only 18 horses remained. The caretaker once again cleverly arranged the 18 horses, so that there were 5 horses on each side of the square stable. How do you think he was able to do it? Arrange the 18 horses in the stable with 5 on each side.

How many more horses can the thief steal before the king notices something is wrong? Try making the arrangements yourself.

## The Longest Land Route—Adding Large Numbers

The longest distance one can travel by road is between Talon (in Russia) and Sagres (in Portugal). It is 15,150 km long.

In 2019, the North-South Corridor was the longest land route within India, starting from Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir and_ ending at Kanniyakumari in Tamil Nadu. Do you know how long it was? Let us find out.

One of the places on the North-South Corridor was 1,855 km from Srinagar and 1,862 km from Kanniyakumari. What was the total length of the North-South Corridor in 2019?

Note for Teachers: Encourage the learners to understand that when we multiply a number by 10, it becomes 10 times, and each digit moves one place value to the left. Multiplying by 100 makes the number 100 times larger, shifting each digit two place value to the left. Let them notice the pattern of zeros in the place value table

## Many Ways to Multiply

Do you think they are all correct? Why do

Half of 18 is 9. 9x5 is 45 and 9x5 is 45. oy, I added 45 and 45 together to get 90.

First, I doubled 18 to get 36. Then I doubled 36 to get 72 and then Iadded 18 to 72 to get 90.

I separated 18 into 8 and 10. 8x5 is 40. 10x5 is 50. then I added 40 and 50 together to get 90. =

18x5 = 9x10. So, 90.

I did 20x5, which is 100. Then I took away 2x5, which is 10. So, 100-10 = 90. ~

## Choose wisely!

Choice 1: Take 5 gold coins and double the number of coins every day for 7 days.

Choice 2: Take 3 gold coins and triple the number of coins every day for 7 days.

Choice 3: Take 1 gold coin and multiply the number of coins by 5 every day for 7 days.

Minister 1—] will take 5 gold coins and double the number of coins every day for 7 days.

Minister 2—I will take 3 gold coins and triple the number of coins every day for 7 days.

Minister 3—I will take 1 gold coin and multiply the number of coins by 5 every day for 7 days.

The King gave 5 coins to Minister 1, 3 coins to Minister 2 and 1 coin to Minister 3.

Which of the rewards would you have chosen?

After a week, the 3 ministers were surprised at the final amount of gold

coins. Guess who received the most gold coins? Calculate how much gold coins each minister received.

## Patterns

You may have seen woven baskets of different kinds. If youlook closely, you will notice different weaving patterns on each basket.

We will try weaving some mats with paper strips.

1. Let us make paper mats.

You will need—A coloured paper (30 cm long and 20 cm wide) and eight paper strips of two different colours (3 cm wide and longer than 20 cm).

(a) Take a coloured paper 30 cm long and 20 cm wide.

(b) Fold the coloured paper in half along the longer side.

(c) Draw vertical lines at equal distances from the closed end and cut slits leaving a gap of 3 cm at the top.

(d) Carefully unfold the paper. There will be no cuts in the paper at the top and the bottom.

(e) Now cut 8 paper strips of 3 cm width in 2 colours and of length slightly longer than 20 cm.

(f) Take one colour strip and weave it across the slits going 1 under and 1 over, and again 1 under and 1 over. Repeat it for the first row.

(g) Take one more strip of another colour and weave it across the slits going 1 over and 1 under, and again 1 over and 1 under. Repeat it for the second row.

(h) Weave all the strips in the same alternating pattern. Neatly fold any extra strip ends behind the mat. Your mat is ready!

‘ey Wecandescribe the patternoftheabove weaveasfollows. Row 1—1 under, 1 over, 1 under, 1 over, ... (repeat) Row 2—1 over, 1 under, 1 over, 1 under, ... (repeat)

2. Can you figure out how to make this mat?

Let us try to understand how this mat is woven by looking at the pattern in the first two rows.


## Row 1—2 over, 1 under, 2 over, 1 under, ...


## Row 2—2 under, 1 over, 2 under, 1 over, ...

You can use strips of the same colour or 2 different colours, one for each row.

3. Try to weave a pattern, using the rules given below.

Pet et st Pat Row 1—2 over, 1 under, 2 over, 1 under, ... (repeat). LF alt aij ie i Fy) ~=Row 2—1 under (do not repeat), 3 over, 3 under, 3 over, iI LA =I LF 3 under, ... (repeat).

4. Can you work out the steps for any of these designs and weave the pattern?

Write the steps of the pattern in your notebook for each row until it starts repeating.

Draw the following pattern on a grid paper. Part of it is done for you. Now, complete

We often use tiles of the same shape or a combination of shapes to cover a region.

You can see pentagons (5-sided figures) in this figure. As all its sides are equal it is a regular pentagon. Shapes that have equal sides are called regular shapes. We have placed 3 pentagons around a point. Can we fit one more into the empty space?

Pentagons cannot fill a region without leaving gaps. So, we say that regular pentagons do not tessellate.

Can regular triangles fit together at a point without any gap? How many of them fit together? (A sample triangle is given at the end of the book). Do you see that regular triangles fit around a point as shown here?

Regular triangles when fitted around a point leave no gaps and there is no overlap.

Triangles with all equal sides are also called equilateral triangles.

Therefore, equilateral triangles tessellate. Can squares (a regular 4-sided shape) fit together around a point without any gap or overlap? Try it out using cutouts of squares (a sample square is given at the end of the book). How many squares did you need?

Can five squares fit together around a point without any gaps or overlaps? Why or why not?

Can regular hexagons (6-sided shapes with equal sides) fit together around a point without any gaps or overlaps? Try and see (a sample hexagon is given at the end of the book). How many fit together at a point?

Continue the pattern given below and colour it appropriately.

A regular octagon means a shape with eight equal sides.

Do regular octagons fit together without any gaps or overlaps? Try drawing the same and check.

Regular octagons do not tessellate.

Here is a tiling pattern made using two different shapes—squares and triangles. Are the triangles equilateral? Why or why not?

A rhombus is a shape with all equal sides. It has been divided into four triangles.

What shapes are coming together at the marked points?

Are the same set of shapes coming together at these points? Continue the pattern and colour it appropriately.

1. How many different types of triangles can you make?

Now, observe and measure the sides of these triangles. What do you notice? Each triangle has 2 equal sides. Such triangles are called isosceles triangles.

Trace the isosceles triangles on a paper and cut them out. Fold them in half. What do you notice about their angles?

Each isosceles triangle has 2 equal angles.

2. Is it possible to make a triangle where all three sides are equal (equilateral triangle)?

3. Is it possible to make a triangle where all three sides are unequal?

Cut the equilateral triangle provided at the end of the book. Check if all the angles of an equilateral triangle are equal—just like you did with the isosceles triangle. :

Equilateral triangles have equal angles.

Now, cut the equilateral triangle in half. How many

sides of each new triangle are equal?

Triangles that have no equal sides

are called scalene triangles.

Check in scalene triangles whether any two or more angles are equal?

4. How many different 4-sided shapes (quadrilaterals) can you make?

Here are three possible shapes.

Have you made a shape like the one shown on the right?

This shape is called a kite.

What do you notice about the sides of a kite? Side 1 = Side 2.


## Similarly, Side 3 = Side 4.

These sides are called adjacent sides. Here are two other possible quadrilaterals that are not kites.

5. Measure the sides of each of these two quadrilaterals A and B. What do you notice?

Are there any pairs of sides that are equal? Which pairs are equal— adjacent or opposite?

Quadrilaterals whose opposite sides are equal are called parallelograms. What types of angles do quadrilaterals A and B have? Which angles are equal in each of the above parallelograms?

In parallelogram A, opposite angles are equal.

In parallelogram B, all angles are equal and are right angles. Such a parallelogram is called a rectangle.

A rectangle is a special type of parallelogram.

Note for Teachers: Please note that three different ways have been suggested above for adding and subtracting weights. The need for these different strategies arises depending on the numbers used. If the numbers are 250, 500, 750 or even 200, 400, 500, etc., we can add and subtract numbers orally. In fact, we should encourage these mental strategies to be able to use mathematics for daily life problem-solving. When numbers are not amenable to such oral calculations, the learners can choose one of the column strategies provided here, based on their comfort. Help learners observe the similarity between subtraction of numbers and subtraction of quantities like weights.

Prem and Manu want to paste ‘Happy Birthday’ cutouts on a wall for Lali’s birthday. While preparing cutouts of letters, they observe that some letters can be cut out in an easy way.

They remember that they learnt about reflection symmetry and lines of

symmetry in Grade 4. They used their knowledge of lines of symmetry to £ make the cutouts. The letter A has a vertical line of Sepa ety, So, to cut

out the letter ‘A’-—

1. Fold a paper in half.

2. Draw half of the letter A along the fold.

3. Cut along the outline.

4. Open the paper to see the full letter A.

The letter H has two lines of symmetry. Pp 1. Fold the paper into one-fourth (once vertically, once horizontally).

triangles cover Table 1. squares cover Table 3. rectangles cover Table 4.

The region covered by the triangles, squares or rectangles is called the area of the table.

To find the area of a region, we usually fill it with shapes that tile (no gaps and overlaps), like squares, rectangles and triangles.

Do circles tile? Can we use them to cover a region?

The area of Table 1 is triangle units. The area of Table 3 is square units. The area of Table 4 is rectangle units.

Do you see that the area of rectangle A is larger than that of BP What about B and C?

Which shape has a larger area among A and C? How will you find out?

Let us put these rectangles on a square grid. Now, can you identify the rectangle that has the largest area?

Using square grids is the most convenient way to find the area of regions. We say that the area of a square with sides 1 unit is 1 unit square.

1. Compare the areas of the two gardens given below on the square grid. Share your observations.

Area of Garden A = cm square Area of Garden B = cm square

Note for Teachers: Tiles of several shapes like triangles, rectangles, and squares can be used to measure the area of a region. We choose a square as a unit for measuring area as its sides are of equal length. Therefore, we can define the area of a unit square as 1 unit square. This allows us to measure area, similar to that of measuring length. — ———_ oe — —i.eren oe oe — @e

Joseph Uncle takes stock of the play items (toys, board games, and sports items) in his store a week before the summer break. He tries to record the items in his shop using a pictograph.

He notices that there are too many items of each kind in his shop and it is not easy to

make a picture for every item.


## Suggest some ways to him.

Dipesh used a scale while recording the items in the pictograph. A scale helps record a large number of things using fewer icons.

Now, answer the following questions based on the above pictograph. (1) How many toys does Joseph Uncle have? (2) How many board games does Joseph Uncle have? (3) How many total play items does Joseph Uncle have?

Is there any other scale that you can use to make the pictograph? Choose your scale and show the same data using a pictograph in your notebook.
