## Foreword

The foundational stage in school education, as envisaged by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the holistic development of children. It enables students not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into a more challenging preparatory stage.

The preparatory stage acts as a bridge between the foundational and the middle stages, spanning three years from Grades 3 to 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the foundational stage. While the play-way, discovery, and the activity-based learning methods continue, students are also introduced to textbooks and formal classroom settings. This introduction aims to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, thinking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science and social sciences, ensuring that students are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-emotional levels to effortlessly transition to the middle stage.

Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023, brought out, as a follow-up to the NEP 2020, a new subject area called ‘The World Around Us’ at the preparatory stage is introduced. This subject aims to provide environmental education through an experiential learning approach, connecting students’ experiences with the basic concepts of different subject areas, which they will study at the middle stage.

Our Wondrous World, the textbook for The World Around Us, has been designed to help students connect their day-to-day learning about their world to the basic concepts of various subject areas—science, social sciences and environmental education. It aims to enhance their sensitivity towards their environment, develop skills to work with the community, and foster a positive attitude towards various professions.

Our Wondrous World emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, and the values and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness, integrating appropriate ICT tools and school-based assessments.

11-Jul-25 2:11:04 PM

In Grades 3 and 4, students were familiarised with units— Our Communities, Life Around Us, Health and Well-being, Things Around Us and Our Environment. Grade 5 being the final year of the preparatory stage enables students for the middle stage in a complimentary way. It lays a sound foundation for students in science and social science, so that they are ready to learn these subjects separately from middle stage. The Grade 5 students are familiarised with vibrant India, important role of water through the example of river Godavari, health and well-being at home and school, what and how of different things around the students, and the environment on and around the planet Earth. Content and processes have been designed by keeping in view the age, experiences, interests and diversity of students everywhere. This textbook also carries a wide range of interesting facts about India’s traditions, culture and achievements.

Student’s innate curiosity at this stage needs to be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on the core learning principles. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance the engagement rather than mere attraction.

While this textbook is valuable, students also need to explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours.

An effective learning environment motivates students, keeps them engaged and fosters curiosity and wonder—vital for learning.

I recommend this textbook with confidence to all students and teachers at the preparatory stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet the expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving the publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content.

## About the Textbook

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 in alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has introduced The World Around Us (TWAU) as a core curricular area at the preparatory stage of school education for Grades 3-5. As described in NCF-SE 2023, it aims to address the natural curiosity of students and help them gain a more systematic understanding of the natural, physical and social environment in their immediate context. Guided by the policy and the curriculum framework, the TWAU textbook is designed as a learning companion that encourages observation, questioning, investigation, reflection, and expression among students. It integrates science, social science, environmental studies, and foundational and vocational skills into one cohesive narrative, promoting interdisciplinary thinking and action. Through this approach, students begin to recognise patterns, processes and relationships between people and nature, cause and consequence, tradition and change.

The Grade 5 textbook of TWAU, Our Wondrous World, continues the journey from the foundations laid in Grades 3 and 4. As students progress into the final year of the preparatory stage, this book reinforces experiences of exploration, experiments, play and discovery by guiding learners toward more structured, yet interactive learning. The textbook embodies the core principles of experiential learning through nature walks, observations, interviews, model-making, experiments and surveys. Students are encouraged to apply the basics of the scientific methods—to observe, hypothesise, test and conclude. In doing so, they also develop environmental awareness, ethical reasoning, empathy and a sense of responsibility towards others, and the planet.

With the vision of developing cognitive, emotional, and physical capacities through holistic and integrated learning, this textbook adopts a student-centric, activity-rich and inquiry-driven pedagogy. It also supports a gradual progression from immediate surroundings to broader contexts. This structured exploration of the environment is assumed to develop the competencies identified for preparatory stage through TWAU based on the curricular goals identified in NCF-SE 2023. While designing and developing the content and activities, effort has been made for providing students with varied experiences of exploring environment, which helps students to understand the interdependence in the world and develop sensitivity towards environmental, and social issues. Throughout the book, inputs have been given for students to recognise the importance of

11-Jul-25 2:11:05 PM

safety of self and others, gearing towards their responsible behaviour in different situations. Collection of data and their analysis through observation, experiments and social survey would surely provide seeds of skills of questioning, and arriving at probable solutions. The book also tries to provide basic understanding of the concepts that would be discussed in different disciplines at middle stage. In addition, the book provides experience of map reading and interpretation as tools of exploring the world.

The Indian Knowledge System (IKS) is organically integrated, offering students a lens to value indigenous practices, local crafts, folklore, and the wisdom of communities. Language, mathematics, and arts are also naturally embedded through cross-disciplinary activities. Designed with inclusivity and diversity at its heart, this book provides unique experiences for learners of different abilities and backgrounds. It encourages collaborative learning, respects multilingual contexts, and fosters the values of care, cooperation and democratic citizenship.

The textbook has 10 chapters, structured into five thoughtfully curated units—Life Around Us, Health and Well-being, Incredible India, Things Around Us and Our Amazing Planet. The book provides opportunities for students to engage with real-life issues, local knowledge systems, and diverse cultures spread across our nation. Each unit has briefly outlined the desired competencies and the concepts covered. It is attempted to follow different approaches in each chapter. In the form of a narrative, Chapter 1: ‘Water—The Essence of Life’ emphasises how we need to be responsible and why it is important to maintain the balance in nature. This is followed by Chapter 2: Journey of a River’ which is written in the form of an autobiography of the river Godavari to show how environmental, social and economic aspects are interconnected. Chapter 3: ‘The Mystery of Food’ uses an exploratory style, emphasising looking at things in the world around us that we do not see with the naked eye, for example, the discussion on microbes. Chapter 4: ‘Our School—A Happy Place’ is based on research, planning and action. Chapter 5: ‘Our Vibrant Country’ is about learning through things that are around us that we have not noticed or examined like the currency notes. Chapter 6:‘Some Unique Places’ is a travelogue about discovering unique places in India, while Chapters 7 and 8 use activities and experiments to engage students. Chapter 7: ‘Energy — How Things Work’ and Chapter 8: ‘Clothes— How Things are Made’ are extension of the themes—how things work and how things are made as discussed in Grades 3 and 4. Chapter 9: ‘Rhythms of Nature’ gets students to note observations in the journal provided at the back of the book. Looking at things from historical perspectives

in the form of short stories is the main focus of the Chapter 10: ‘Earth—Our Shared Home’ through which the concept of ‘Earth’ as a well-connected planet is being exposed to students. In the chapter, we are also highlighting the connections between what we do and the environment around us. In brief, the students are exposed to the world around us, how it is made, where things come from, what is their history, how we could be vulnerable and how we can act responsibly by understanding how the world around us is interconnected and how our ancient Indian philosophy of treating the world as one family, ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, is important for sustainability. This book provides scope for students to record their observations in four quarters of the year in ‘Seasons’ Journal’ at the end. Teachers would guide students for doing so.

Assessment is integrated into the learning process through reflective exercises, projects, group work, and creative expressions. ‘Let us reflect’ sections promote self-assessment and metacognition in alignment with the competencies given in the NCF-SE. Questions are placed in the book to promote critical thinking. The teacher needs to be more of a facilitator than someone who has all the answers. The teacher is encouraged to vary and extend the activities in the book as well as to initiate discussion in the classroom. The intention is to encourage the spirit of inquiry and openness to questions that may seem outside the curriculum. Some of these may deserve a discussion, if not an answer. ‘Notes to the Teacher’ offers guidance on facilitating rich classroom discussions and adapting content to local contexts. It is also important that teachers use adequate learning teaching materials such as maps and globes as without these, the designed activities would be incomplete and there is fear of achieving the competencies.

Ultimately, Our Wondrous World aims to kindle a lifelong curiosity and joy in learning, enabling students to see their lives as part of a larger, interconnected world. It serves as a bridge between lived experiences and abstract ideas, between the local and the global, and between learning and living. The book has been designed as an exciting tool for the hands of the teacher and the student. The book aims to inculcate a sense of pride in India’s rich diversity, which is our strength. We hope that this textbook will provide a strong foundation for developing a wide range of competencies in students in the years ahead.

## Unit 1

This unit at the preparatory stage highlights the crucial role of nature as a home to animals, birds and insects. Students in Grades 3 and 4 have explored soil, air and water. They also learned how life evolves in different landforms depending upon the availability of soil, air, water and sunlight.

This unit in Grade 5 presents the importance of water in life and ecosystems. It also covers its various forms, movement, and role in shaping


## Chapter 1 n.indd 1

land and supporting habitats. The unit conveys water as a unique and limited essence of life—showing how it helps in sustaining the life on Earth.

It also gives examples from the lives of people, who stay close to nature. They enjoy clean treasures from nature and develop various materials available from nearby forest and surroundings. Their lifestyles and productions with locally available materials reflect how life can be happy, and creative in the lap of nature.

10-Jul-25 6:07:45 PM |


## Note to the Teacher

This unit includes two chapters: Chapter 1 ‘Water— The Essence of Life’ and Chapter 2 ‘Journey ofa River’. Following are the key concepts covered in these chapters.


## Chapter 1: Water— The Essence of Life

‘Water—The Essence of Life’ introduces students to its various forms and different sources (freshwater and saltwater) of water. It also highlights the importance of water in different activities in the society. This chapter introduces the continuous movement of water in different forms through the water cycle. It also explores how water shapes the land and supports life in freshwater habitats, and highlights the need to conserve water.


## Chapter 2: Journey of a River

This chapter follows the story of the river Godavari from its origin to its delta. Through maps, stories and illustrations, it explores the tributaries of Godavari and aquatic life in the river. It familiarises students with the dams built on the river. Students learn how the river gets polluted. This chapter highlights the

ways rivers support ecosystems, people and culture. After reading this chapter students will understand that water is a limited and shared resource which must be used wisely.


## Chapter 1 n.indd 2


## How to Facilitate

Encourage students to think about water bodies near their homes or schools. Inspire them to explore where the water comes from and where

it goes.

The Activity 6 in Chapter 1 on mustard seed shows how rivers flow from higher to lower ground and follow the shape of the land. Use the map of India to explore which rivers flow into which seas and how landforms (like mountains) guide their direction.

Talk about what happens to rainwater in their school or neighbourhood. Use this to start a conversation on how cities and villages plan for water.

Help students list different ways in which water plays an important role in our life. Connect this to ideas of sharing and saving water. Let them think about how water is stored in their homes (tanks, pots, etc.) and how a dam works as a big water storing unit.

Engage students in role-plays to critically think about both the scarcity and excess of water.


## Encourage students

to discuss with their parents or grandparents about festivals, stories, or memories connected to rivers. This will help them see rivers not just as physical things, but as part of their community and culture.

It is raining. Afreen rushed to the window where Jyoti was already watching tiny raindrops slide down the glass. “Where do you think all this water comes from, and where does it go>?” asked Afreen.

Come, let us follow the journey of water.

But first, let us see how much water there is on Earth.

Although most of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, the majority of it is salty, leaving less

10-Jul-25 6:07:46 PM

amount of freshwater. All living beings—people, animals, birds, and plants—depend on freshwater to survive. It is essential for drinking, growing crops, and carrying out daily activities. Many plants and animals also live in freshwater. Without water, life would not be possible.

Now, imagine if all the water on earth were in this glass, then the freshwater would only be as much as in a teaspoon!

Where can we find freshwater? Identify the different freshwater sources from the images given below and write their names.


## Sources of Water

Jyoti was curious, “Is there water in the air too? And is snow a form of water?”.


## Water has Different Forms

We already know the different forms of water— liquid (as in rain), solid (as in ice) and vapour (as in steam). Let us understand more about this through a simple activity!

Through these experiments, we found out that water can change into ice and steam, and it can also return to its liquid form.


## Water Cycle

Let us understand how such changes take place in nature.

Take a transparent bag.

Use a marker to draw the sun, clouds, trees and arrows on it as shown in the picture. Fill one-third of it with coloured water.

Tip: You can use blue paint or food dye for this.

Seal the bag tightly to prevent any leaks.

Place it in the sunlight. After a few hours, observe the changes inside the bag.

As you have seen in the above activity, the Sun’s heat causes the water to turn into water vapour. When the water vapour cools, it forms small droplets inside the bag. Eventually, these droplets fall back down.

Similarly in nature, heat causes water from different sources, like oceans and rivers, to become water vapour. Water vapour forms the clouds, which come down as rain, snow and hail. This water goes back into rivers, lakes and oceans.

This constant circular movement of water in nature is called the water cycle.

Take a transparent glass. e Fill half of it with soil.

e Slowly pour water into the soil using : a spoon. ¢ Observe what happens.

When it rains, some water is soaked up by the soil. This water sinks through the layers of soil and rocks. The water that gets stored deep underground is called groundwater. We dig wells, borewells, tube wells and handpumps to draw this water from the ground for our use.


## Activity 5

Tick the image that will help in groundwater recharge.

Do you ever wonder how river flows?

A river often begins its journey from up in the mountains and flows down across the land. Let us understand this through an activity.


## Activity 6

Material Required: An old newspaper and a cup of mustard seeds or any other small seeds.


## Procedure

e Take a sheet froma newspaper and crumple it to create folds. Take another sheet and place it over the crumpled paper. Press it down so that the slopes are gentle. Now, slowly pour the mustard seeds from the cup on to the highest point of the slope. Observe the movement of the seeds.

1. What did you observe about the mustard seeds?

2. Are they moving in a straight line, or do they spread out in different directions?

3. Are they collecting in some areas? Do they gather like water gathers in lakes, rivers and so on?

Water flows, stops or curves according to the shape of the land formations in its path. The flow of water can also change the shape of land.

On the basis of Activity 6 with mustard seeds, discuss how

some rivers flow towards the Arabian Sea while some flow towards the Bay of Bengal.

## Who Eats Whom?—A River Food Chain Game

e Distribute slips of paper to students. Each student writes what they choose to be (for example, small fish, big fish, frog, bird, human, crocodile, otter, etc.) Ask the students to think about what they eat, and who eats them. Use a string to connect the students who depend on each other for food. Discuss what would happen if one animal disappears (for example, what if all the fish are gone?).


## Types of Plants in Water

Through this activity, we discovered the rich variety of plants and animals that live in freshwater habitats. These living beings have special features —like floating leaves, fins, or long roots—that help them survive and grow in water. This reminds us how essential freshwater is for supporting life on Earth.

In this chapter, we learned that water exists in different forms—ice, water, and vapour. We saw how water keeps moving through the water cycle; changing its form as it travels through the air, land, and sky. We also explored how aquatic plants and animals live in and around water, and depend on water for their survival.

## Where I Begin, Where I Flow


## Who am I?

Yes! I am a river.

I am Godavari. My journey begins high up in the Western Ghats at Trimbakeshwar in Maharashtra.

Although I start out as a stream, as I move across the land, rainwater and other streams join me, making me wider and stronger. The small streams joining are my tributaries.

I travel 1,465 kilometres before joining the Bay of Bengal. I am the second longest river in India after river Ganga.


## W Chapter 2.indd> 24

Look at the image given below and answer the following. 1. Name the states that Godavari flows through.

2. Name a dam and a wildlife sanctuary along the length of Godavari.

There are fascinating stories about me, many from the Ramayana and the Puranas. I am called Dakshina Ganga because I flow through southern India and am regarded as sacred.

In places like Nashik, near where I begin, people come from all around to take a dip in my holy waters, especially during events like the Godavari Pushkaram.


## The Life I Hold

I flow allyear round which makes mea perennial river. Some rivers flow only when they receive water in the rainy season, which makes them seasonal rivers.

I pass through rich forests full of wildlife, including the tiger, barking deer, the Indian golden gecko and the famed red sandalwood trees. You have learnt in the last chapter that freshwater sources like me are home to many plants and animals.

When I reach the sea, I spread out into many small streams that form a delta. My freshwater meets

## The Many Ways I Support Lives

Since ancient times, people have always built their homes near rivers or water bodies. Can you guess why?

Do you know the many ways I support people every single day? I provide water to people in the many towns and villages around me.

The water for all houses, schools and fields comes from me. I not only help people drink, cook and wash, but also help them to grow food, and make things in their factories. I also support many livelihoods.

My water is carried in pipes and canals, and shared by many.

## Dams—Storing My Water, Changing My Flow

Did you know that there are more than 900 dams that store my water so people can use it even during dry seasons, to drink, grow crops and make electricity.

But have you ever wondered what happens to me when a dam is built? What happens to the forests, animals and the people living near me?

A dam is like a giant wall that blocks my flow and stores water in a large water body called a reservoir. While this stored water helps many people, it also floods land that was once home to animals and people. Many have to leave their homes and shift elsewhere when dams are built.


## Chapter 2.indd 26

What problems can arise after a dam is built. How can they be solved?


## What Pollutes Me and Why it Matters

With more people and factories coming up near my

banks; waste, plastic and dirty water pollutes me. Sometimes I do not smell or look clean. Yet people

use my water, which could make them sick. I wish

I could tell them to help keep me clean and free 27 from waste.

Chapter 2.indd 27 10-Jul-25 6:10:40 PM

One important way to do this is by creating less waste in the first place by using eco-friendly products.

The fish, turtles, and birds that live in and around me have nowhere else to go. Slowly, they are beginning to disappear. This makes me very sad.

River with clean water Surface covered by ‘green blanket’

Sometimes fertilisers that are used to grow crops get washed down into my water. They make plants and other organisms grow very fast, until they cover my surface like a ‘green blanket’, which slowly starts choking all the life inside me. It becomes hard for the fish to breathe. Also, my water becomes unsafe for people to drink.

I must say that many people are trying to help

## When a River Floods

Most of the time, I flow gently, helping life grow all around me. But I never forget that I am powerful. When there is too much rain, I expand and become faster, deeper and bigger. I roar through the land, faster and wilder than anyone can imagine. This is when I cannot help overflowing my banks and flooding large areas.

When too much rain falls, all the water rushes into me and my expanding waters flood houses, fields and roads causing great damage, and destruction. People and animals often have to leave their homes to stay safe.

## About the Unit

This unit at the preparatory stage familiarises students with different types of food, importance of balanced food, healthcare, and maintaining good health with regular exercise and rest. Students also learn how traditional agricultural, and cultural practices supported health and well-being in sync with changes in seasons.

This unit in Grade 5 helps students explore how everyday choices support personal and collective well-being. Students learn how to take care of food


## Chapter 3.indd 38.


## Health and Well-being

and explore various traditional Indian methods of food preservation. They learn about the role of good microbes and cultural practices that help keep the food safe.

This unit also encourages students to take care of their home and surroundings for better health. They learn how to make their school a greener, cleaner and more caring place through actions like waste management, water conservation, and practising kindness.

10-Jul-25 6:11:51 PM


## This


## Note to the Teacher

unit consists of two chapters.

Chapter 3 ‘The Mystery of Food’ and Chapter 4 ‘Our School—A Happy Place’.


## Chapter 3: The Mystery of Food

‘The Mystery of Food’ follows detective Disha as she explores how food spoils due to microbes and why certain foods last longer. It covers the science behind food preservation, various preservation methods and their cultural significance. It also touches on the role of good microbes, the importance of proper food storage, and consumption in promoting health, and hygiene.


## Chapter 4: Our School—A Happy Place


## Chapter 3.indd 39.

‘Our School—A Happy Place’ introduces the idea of green school—a space that is clean, safe and caring for students, teachers, and the environment.

Students are encouraged to reflect on improving their school through waste management, water conservation and tree plantation, while learning the importance of kindness, respect and positive behaviour in creating a pleasant school environment.


## How to Facilitate

Encourage active observation and experimentation. Help students record their findings in a ‘Food Detective’ or ‘School Explorer’ notebook.

Guide students in sharing personal stories or small-group discussions based

on their family’s food habits, or preservation echniques.


## Encourage students

o explore and share any local or cultural raditions related to food preservation.

Use real objects and school areas (like the kitchen, garden or corridors) as learning spaces.


## Arrange for students

o interact with elders, kitchen staff, recyclers or local vendors to learn about food preservation, waste management, and community practices.

Motivate students to think critically about their food habits, the role of microbes in health, and how these concepts relate to environmental sustainability.

## The Mystery of Food


## Food Spoilage

It was a sunny Monday morning. Disha was a curious girl, always eager to explore things around her. She found the lunch box she had forgotten in school last Friday. There was one of her favourite foods uttapam left in it three days ago, she remembered. When she opened the box, a foul smell came out of it. Her yummy uttapam had some coloured patches. What happened to my uttapam, she wondered! This was a mystery for

Disha. ee Disha was eager to find out what had caused = it—detective Disha was now ready to solve the as mysteries of the world around her. Food is an EES} important part of our world. Disha started her

## Chapter 3.indd 41

Mystery #1: What made my uttapam spoil?

As soon as she reached home, Disha ran to her Anna (elder brother in Tamil) Aditya, who was in Grade 8.

“Anna, what are these coloured patches on the food? It does not smell good!”, Disha asked.

He looked and smiled, “That’s mould, Disha. These tiny living things are called microbes, which grew on your food and changed it.”

Disha enquired, “Microbes? Are they like little lice?”.

“Even smaller!”, said Anna. “So tiny, you need an instrument called a microscope to see them; they are everywhere, all around us. They grow on different things and make changes to them. Some microbes help us in making curd and digesting our food. They

a also change the taste and smell of the uttapam, and other food items. We can see this mould as it is made up of a colony of thousands of microbes.”

Disha’s eyes lit up with curiosity. She quickly noted it down in her notebook—

‘syuatynu U2 you flan $1 J “pj4om ay} U1 sjaynw fo saonpoid jsabsn) ay} si vIpuy

Have you ever had an upset stomach? Do you know what could have caused it? What could happen if spoiled food is eaten by mistake? If yes, what did you do to get well? Share your experiences with the class.

Mystery #2: Why do some foods spoil faster?

That afternoon, Disha noticed a slice of bread that she had left on the balcony for a cat, that did not come for two days. It had coloured patches on it, but the pickles her Paati (grandmother in Tamil) had made two months. ago were still delicious as it was covered with oil!

“Strange!”, whispered Disha. “Why does some food spoil fast, and some last for a long time?”


## e)

Why do you think food gets spoiled?

10-Jul-25 6:11:53 PM


## Chapter 3.indd 43

She went back to her Anna and asked, “What do these microbes need to grow?”.

Anna replied, “Microbes need moisture, air and the right temperature to grow. If we remove any one of these, we can stop them in their tracks. All life needs water and air to survive”.

Finding #2 We need to keep air and water away from the microbes.


## Food Preservation

Mystery #3: How do we save our food from spoilage? Detective Disha decided to look for answers at home.

Let us observe


## Drying and Dehydration

She saw her Amma (mother) and Appa (father) drying chillies on a mat under the Sun on the balcony. “Why are you drying these, Amma?”, she asked. “To make chilli powder. This should last us for the entire year!”, Amma answered.

Pickling and Oiling In the kitchen, her Paati was pouring mustard oil into a jar of pickled green mangoes. “But why is oil added to the pickle?”, Disha asked eagerly.

“Oil stops air from getting in”, Paati explained. “That keeps the pickles safe!”

Finding #4 Oil keeps out air and stops the growth of microbes.

Aditya Anna has an upset stomach after eating food in a fair.


## e)

Did you ever have an upset stomach, vomiting or indigestion? Did you use any home remedies? Write about the home remedy given to you.

Have your parents given you curd or some product like buttermilk made from it, for an upset stomach. There are small microbes in curd that join the good microbes in your stomach to help in digestion. If the problem is severe, you may have to consult a doctor and take medicines.

Finding #8 Sometimes, bad eating habits can also lead to indigestion.

Disha’s notebook was now full of her findings.

My Food, My Pride During her investigations, Disha learned that there are many traditional practices related to food being passed on from one generation to another in the family.

She made her detective case diary on ‘My Food, My Pride’. Let us look at some new entries in Disha’s diary and help her complete some of them.

## A Visit to the Vegetable Market

Thatha (grandfather) goes to the vegetable market daily. He buys fresh fruits and vegetables. It was fun to be in the vegetable market with him. Disha observed how he carefully examined the fruits or vegetables at the market before he bought them.


## Activity 4

Do you ever accompany your elders for buying vegetables and fruits? During such visits, observe how elders select

fruits and vegetables in the market. Write one thing that you learnt from your shopping trip and write it as a Finding #9, the way Disha would write.


## The Joy of Eating Seasonal Fruits!

It was raining. Appa bought lychees on his way home. Disha exclaimed with delight, “Yummy lychees, after almosta year!”. Appa said, “Lychee is a seasonal fruit so we need to wait for it!”. Disha could see the joy on everyone’s face as they peeled and shared the delicious fruits with each other.

Appa added, “But nothing to beat our local mangoes, they are so fresh because they did not have to travel far to reach us!”.

## @)mp

Name three seasonal fruits or vegetables of your region. For example, amla in winter and jamun in summer.


## Chew Right!

Investigation: What happens to food inside your mouth?

Detective Disha was not done solving mysteries yet. “What happens to food after we eat it?”, she wondered.

She looked in the mirror, opened her mouth wide and said, “Aaaaah!”.


## Activity 5

When you eat, try chewing each item properly till it breaks down into smaller pieces and then into mush. Which teeth did you use to cut and chew? Look at the diagram given on the next page and name them.

10-Jul-25 6:11:55 PM


## Chapter 3.indd 51


## Teeth and Chewing

Anna said, “We have different teeth—incisors to cut, canines to tear, premolars to crush and molars to grind”.

Finding #10 Chewing food properly breaks down the food and releases saliva which helps in digestion.

Finding #11 Different types of teeth have different uses.

Oral Hygiene Disha was having a toothache. She visited the dentist with her parents. The doctor found a cavity—a hole in the tooth and treated it.

“Rinse your mouth after eating. Brush your teeth regularly”, the dentist advised. “Eat fewer sweets.”


## Finding #12

Oral hygiene is important. For a dental check-up or if any of your teeth are aching, you may need to see a dentist.


## The Danger of Choking

“Do not gulp down your food!”, warned Amma at dinner. “Chew your food properly!”

Finding #13 I must eat my food slowly to avoid choking on it.


## Note to the Teacher

The teacher needs to make sure to bring learner’s attention towards taking smaller mouthfuls and chewing them properly before swallowing. Also, advise them to avoid talking or laughing with food in their mouth.

## Our School—A Happy Place


## Green School

Aasha and Mohit were walking to school together. “Do you like going to school?” Aasha asked.

Mohit smiled happily and said, “I love school! It is where I see my friends, play games and learn new things every day. It is my happy place”.

Our school is a place where we feel safe, and cared for. It is where we learn so many things.

Asha said, “My school teaches us how to care for plants, trees and animals. I want to make my school better like a green school”.

“What is a green school?” Mohit asked.

“My brother told me once, green school is a school where we manage our waste, save water, use electricity carefully, and make the campus green by planting more trees and taking care of them”.

Aasha and Mohit share their idea with their classmates. Everyone became curious. What about our school? Can we make it a green school too?

Their teacher Anupam, who is teaching them “The World Around Us’ asked, “I enjoyed your discussion, I want to know how will you begin this>”.

Aasha shared her suggestion with her classmates, “Let us take a closer look at our school and decide what we can do to make our school a happy, safe and green school”.

Be a School Explorer! You and your classmates can form ‘School Explorer Teams’. Here are some name ideas for your groups to choose from:


## e Water watchers


## ¢ Electricity savers


## e Waste warriors


## ¢ Green guardians


## ¢ Traffic trackers

Before you start exploring, each group has to

decide what to observe.


## Chapter 4.indd 57

In many villages, people clean floors with cow dung and mud to keep insects away and keep the house cool.

Here are some suggestions:


## Electricity Savers

Are lights and fans ‘on’ when no one is using them?

Do the classrooms use natural light?

Which areas of the school feel the hottest and the coolest during the day?

Water Watchers Are there any leaking taps? Is water being wasted?

Are water tanks clean and covered?

Are there any wet places that could be breeding mosquitoes?


## Green Guardians


## Are there trees or plants in the school?

Who takes care of them? Where can we plant more?

Do birds or butterflies visit these areas?

Is there a compost pit in the school?


## Traffic Trackers

What happens outside the school gate during arrival and exit times?

Is there a_ pedestrian crossing across the road for children?

Do vehicles speed in front of the school?


## Waste Warriors

Where do you find litter? What kinds of litter do you see?

Are there enough dustbins around the school?

Are the students using these bins? Why or why not?


## Are there separate bins for food waste and other waste?

10-Jul-25 6:17:21 PM

Once you have finished making your explorations, it is time to sit together and discuss your findings with the class.

1. What did you find?

2. Was there anything that made you feel concerned?

3. Did anything surprise you? What was it?

4. What made you feel proud?

Let us understand more about each of the things we tried to explore.


## Waste Management

We can reduce waste by using only what we need, reusing things and not throwing away useful items. However, some waste such as food peels, leftovers and paper still remain. We have learned in earlier classes about the importance of separating waste into dry and wet categories to manage it better, and to keep our surroundings clean.

2)


## Chapter 4.indd 59

Can you name the colour of the bin used for the following?


## Dry waste: Wet waste:

Have you noticed that things like old newspapers are never thrown into these bins? They are usually kept aside and given to the traditional recyclers. Different recyclers collect different items. What are the various recyclers in your area called? Find out what each one collects.

1. What things does your school give to recyclers?

2. Ask your parents and find out if there are any items that they had set aside to give to the recyclers. What are they?


## e)

With the help of your teacher, ask a recycler to visit your class and share what they do at work. It will be interesting to find out where these items go and how they can be reused or recycled.


## Note to the Teacher

Extend the discussion about the process of recycling, connecting to Grade 4 activity on recycling paper. Also, encourage the students to think about the contribution of recyclers and sanitation workers, to instil the value of dignity of labour.

10-Jul-25 6:17:22 PM


## Activity 2


## Segregation Game

Make small paper chits (30-40) with the names or drawings of the different items shown below. Add more items to the list based on what you see around your school or home.

Take three empty boxes, and label them— green for wet waste, blue for dry waste, and the third can be labelled as Items for recycler’.

One by one, pick a chit and put it in the box that is correct. After all the chits have been put in the boxes, take one box at a time and discuss whether it has been put correctly.

## Bo Discuss

1. What happens if we do not separate our waste?

2. What can we do to make the work of sanitation workers easier and safer? Ask your teacher to invite a member of the sanitation workers to your classroom. Ask them to share what they do, the challenges they face, and how we can play a better role in waste management.


## Let Us be Cool!

Have you ever thought why some rooms feel warmer than others? Let us explore this and find out what keeps them cool.

Trees that give shade and classrooms with windows where the breeze can come in, can make a difference. A white roof can also make the roof cool because it reflects the Sun’s heat. On the other hand, a black surface absorbs heat.


## Activity 3

Take two tiles or stones, paint one black and the other

white. Keep them under the Sun. After a while, touch

each of them and feel the difference in their temperature. Which one felt cooler?

10-Jul-25 6:17:22 PM

If you have to paint the roof of your school or home white, what would happen?


## Discuss

If your area is getting warmer, what actions can be taken to keep it cool?


## Dripping Water

We all need water every day for many things. Water is a precious treasure. But do we use it carefully?

jubisap ows v $17 ‘Anoujoaja fiuy paau jou saop i ‘dayom GuryuLp 1009 0} pasn ain (spyzou) sjod finjd

You have already looked around your school and checked dripping taps. However, have you ever thought about how much water can be lost, drop by drop? Even a small leak can waste a lot of water over time. Let us find out how!


## Chapter 4.indd 63

Look out for a dripping tap or poke a small hole in a used water bottle filled with water. Now, let the water drip. Collect the dripping water in a glass and carefully measure the time it took for the glass to fill up.

Time taken to fill one glass:

How many glasses would become full in one day?

You will be surprised at how quickly water adds up and how much is wasted without anyone noticing.

## Discuss)

1. What are some easy things we can do in our school to prevent the wastage of water?

2. How can you collect and use rainwater at home or in school?

\ Do you know?

The Jal Shakti Abhiyan is a campaign to save and protect water. It encourages people to plant trees, catch rainwater and use water wisely. Schools can help students learn fixing leaks, collecting rainwater, and learning about the smart water use. By learning and taking small actions, schools can help protect water and teach everyone why saving water matters.

What do these readings tell us?

3. With the help of your teacher, try to find out the names of the trees and plants that attract birds, and butterflies. Try to create a butterfly garden in your school.

Aasha, Mohit and other children felt happy contributing to their school, and also learning about the waste management and saving water. Their class received appreciation during their school assembly.

Their dream to make their school ‘the best green school made them think about problems in their community and society. They felt that as students, they could play an important role by spreading awareness about the issues that are making our lives difficult.

Thomas talked about the problem of road accidents. He had seen one while going home from

10-Jul-25 6:17:23 PM

school the other day. Mohit said, “I think people don’t follow traffic rules, we learned about them in our earlier class”.

What do you think about what Mohit said?


## Traffic Signs

Many accidents happen on the roads because people do not follow the traffic rules correctly. It is very important that we know the rules and follow them.

1. Find out and write at least three traffic rules.

2. Think and write about what you saw at the school gate.

Now, work in small teams to design a signboard for the school gate. Your sign should give a clear message to drivers, parents or students, and help make the area safer.

You can use simple words, drawings or symbols.


## Chapter 4.indd 67

Make your traffic signboard here.


## Discuss

Besides making signboards, what else can we do to improve traffic near the school?

Mohit’s school arranged a session on fire safety. All the students of the class attended this session.

Fire Safety It is very important to learn how to stay safe from dangers like fire. Even if they do not happen often, being prepared can help — everyone feel safer and more confident.

2)

1. Where is the fire extinguisher kept in your school?

2. In case of a fire, where is the assembly point in your school?

10-Jul-25 6:17:23 PM


## Chapter 4.indd 69

3. What should you do if there is a fire or if you smell smoke?

With the teacher’s help, practise a safe fire drill.

1. Move quickly and calmly to the nearest exit route. Do not panic. Do not run.

2. Crawl low under smoke with your mouth covered to breathe cleaner air.

3. Donothidein closets or bathrooms.

4. Help others if it is safe to do so, but never return to the building once you are outside.

5. Go to the assembly point and stay with your group.

6. Once you have reached the assembly point, alert staff or teachers immediately if anyone is missing, or injured.


## What We do Matters!

Just as we all need safety, care and respect to feel well and happy, the way we behave with others at school, at home, or in public places also matters a lot.

Our behaviour can make these places peaceful and welcoming, or uncomfortable and unpleasant. Let us look at some everyday situations to think about what is right and what is not.


## f= @\Activity 6

In small groups, discuss the situations given below. Each group will discuss one situation. One student from each group will then share their ideas with the class. . Two students are pushing and skipping the line at the water tap while others are waiting. . A student is scribbling on a classroom bench with a marker. Another child watches but says nothing. . Someone throws a wrapper in the playground. A younger student copies the same act. . One student keeps teasing and making fun of another student. . A group of students are making noise in a public park and disturbing a small group doing yoga nearby.

Each group would discuss:

1. If you see such a situation unfold before you, what would you do?

2. What steps can we take to prevent such incidents?

The way we behave shows the kind of person we are. Respect and kindness are not just words—we show them by waiting for our turn, using kind words,

10-Jul-25 6:17:24 PM

helping someone and keeping our place clean. When we are kind and polite, everyone feels happy.

We have explored many ways to make our school a happy place by saving water, managing waste, keeping it cool, and caring for plants, places and the people around us. Let us all join hands to make our school, our very own happy place!

1. Out of all the classrooms in your school, which one do you think is the nicest and why?

2. Create a happiness tree. On a wall or chart paper, draw a large tree with many branches. Each student should add a ‘leaf’ with one small action written on it that makes the school a happier place (for example, greeting someone, turning off lights, sharing space, etc.).

3. Sharing one’s feelings is exciting. Write a letter to your teacher on ‘My School— My Happy Place’.

4. Which actions would you extend to your home, neighbourhood and communities to make it a happy place for all? Describe any one of them in detail.

5. Imagine a day in school from someone else’s perspective. Choose any one of the following: e A student who navigates school using a wheelchair. e A student who speaks a different mother tongue. e A sanitation worker at school.

Write a diary entry from their point of view. What they felt? What was easy or hard? What made them smile or worry?

6. As principal for a day, what three changes would you make to enhance happiness, safety and greenery in your school?


## Chapter 4.indd 71

. In groups of 4-5, act out the following:

e A student showing kindness in a difficult situation. e A team solving a school water wastage problem.

¢ A student helping a shy classmate feel included.

After each role-play, ask the class:

What did you see? What was inspiring? Could this happen in real-life?

. Write a one minute speech for your morning assembly

on ‘My Dream School’. Mention what makes it special,

who helps it stay that way and what every student can


## do.

. Take a quick survey, ask five students and one teacher:

(a) What is the one thing that makes them feel happy in school?

(b) What is the one thing that could be improved? (c) What is the one kind thing that they saw today?

Record and present your findings to the class. What did you learn from others?

## Unit 3


## About the Unit

This unit in Grades 3 and 4 has familiarised students with home and communities. In Grade 5, itintroduces them to the different features of the larger society and explores the country with its unique beauty and rich diversity. It indicates how a diverse country stands together with a common goal shared and belief, and demonstrates a meaningful development by setting examples for the world. The traditional Indian belief in ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’


## Chapter 5.indd 73


## Incredible India

is reflected in its socio-cultural practices.

India is a land of colours, voices and stories, where diverse people, traditions and landscapes come together. From school celebrations to coral reefs and mangrove forests, and from currency notes to national symbols—we see how nature, culture and everyday life are deeply connected. This journey helps us discover the richness around us and the shared care that binds us to our home.

10-Jul-25 6:15:48 PM


## Note to the Teacher

This unit consists of two chapters. Chapter 5 ‘Our Vibrant Country’ and Chapter 6 ‘Some Unique Places’.


## Chapter 5: Our Vibrant Country

This chapter introduces students to the vibrancy and diversity of India through familiar events like the Republic Day celebrations in school, national symbols, currency notes, languages, clothing, dance, music and shared values. It encourages students to understand what makes India unique, while also appreciating the unity and spirit of togetherness that ties it all together.


## Chapter 6: Some Unique Places

‘Some Unique Places’ takes students on a journey across diverse ecological regions of India. Through travelling, students explore unique landscapes, rare and endemic species, traditional knowledge, and the deep connection between people and nature. The chapter encourages curiosity, care for the environment, and recognition of India’s natural and cultural richness.


## How to Facilitate

Use the chapter to help students connect their everyday lives to the larger story of India. Encourage them to observe and document local diversity — languages, clothing, festivals and foods.

Encourage students to reflect on what makes their place special, helping them see their home or school

as a unique part of India. Visit local parks, markets, rivers, or community spaces to explore the connections between people and nature. Help children see that

their surroundings are also unique, valuable and full of stories.

Discuss why some animals or traditions exist only in certain places.

Help students see how traditional knowledge

like using scarecrows to keep birds away reflects smart, non-harmful ways for people in staying safe. Encourage them to explore similar examples in their surroundings.

## A Special Day in School

It was 26 January, our Republic Day. We came to school early and all of us gathered around the flagpole in lines. The folded flag was tied at the top. The ground around the flagpole was beautifully decorated with flowers.

Our head teacher pulled the rope, and our tricolour flag unfurled to the rhythm of drums and claps. Together, we sang the National Anthem loudly, with pride and unity. wv .

We enjoyed watching the Republic Day parade in New Delhi—the fighter jets flying in the sky, the state tableaux and the cultural programmes! The parade also featured the Indian Defence Forces—the Army, the Navy, the Airforce, the paramilitary and other forces. We asked our teacher why Republic Day is celebrated on 26 January.

10-Jul-25 6:15:52 PM

India became independent on 15 August 1947. Before that, we were not free to take decisions ourselves. Many brave people struggled hard to make India free. We remember their contributions and celebrate our freedom every year, on this day.

“We celebrate the Independence Day joyfully. On this day, our country became free! Does this mean everyone could do whatever they want?”, asked Priya.

“Imagine what would happen if there were no rules”, said the teacher. “In the same way, a country also needs rules to run smoothly, and keep everyone safe and happy. So, we made a plan and a set of rules for our country. On 26 January 1950, we decided to follow this special book of rules called the Constitution. This is why, we celebrate 26 January as India’s Republic Day every year”.

Then, she asked, “Do you know there are actually two images of him on each note? Hold the note up to the light and see what you can find!”.

We alllooked at the note in light. We were surprised to see a smaller image of Gandhi ji which we had not seen before.

Let us think of a garden and a forest.

Many gardens have fewer varieties of plants. They require constant caring and watering. A forest has many varieties of plants, trees, animals, birds and insects. It is more diverse. The amazing thing about a forest is that all the different plants, trees, animals and birds not only help it to look after itself, but also help it become stronger and more beautiful.

As found in a forest, diversity makes our country stronger and more self-sufficient.


## Diversity Everywhere

Think of the variety of headgear we see in our country! In Rajasthan, men wear a colourful saafa or pagri. In Himachal Pradesh, people wear a topi. Headgear can tell us where someone is from, what they believe in or what they do for a living. It is a significant symbol of tradition, honour and cultural heritage, particularly in weddings, and other formal occasions in many states of our country.

Headgear is also worn for protection from heat or cold, or an injury. Helmets worn by soldiers, construction workers, and people working in mines and tunnels protect them from injury while they are on duty. Road safety helmets are worn by motorcyclists and cyclists, which helps === prevent serious head injuries. Helmets are compulsory

and must be worn while we are on two wheelers.

Another aspect of vibrant India is its art forms including music and dance, which are ways of celebrating, praying, sharing stories and bringing people together. Even a_ simple instrument like a drum looks and sounds different in various parts of the country. Each drum has its own rhythm and sound. It is shaped by the local culture, traditions and materials.

## Some Unique Places

Shanti’s parents seemed busier planning their summer vacation. “Are we doing something different this year?”, she asked. “Maybe we could go to more places rather than staying in one place? I really want to see more of our country now that I am growing up.”

Appa (father) and Amma (mother) smiled, “Shanti, your wish might just come true. We have big plans this time! A trip to a few different places starting from the southernmost tip of India!”.

“From Kanyakumari>?”, Shanti asked. “No, Shanti!”, Appa said to her surprise.


## Look at the map for the southernmost point of India.

Shanti found out from the map that Indira Point is the southernmost tip of India. It is a long chain of islands known as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

\

An island is a land surrounded by water on all sides. There are over a thousand islands in the seas around India that are pi t of the country.

## Islands of India

They started from Vijaya Puram, the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Rani, their local guide, took them through the forest.

“Many of the trees are unique and found only in these islands”, Rani said. Shanti was curious about the big roots growing out of the bottom of the tree and spreading out wide, supporting the tree.

## Rest the paper on a flat

surface again. Does it stay upright now? The base supports the roll like the roots support the

tree to stand upright.

Nature often has the best designs.

“The forests here are home to many animals, colourful birds, butterflies and insects that are unique. Birds like the Andaman wood pigeon and the Andaman hornbill are only found here. That makes these forests very special and important for us to protect”, Rani said.

Rani took them to the Marine Interpretation Centre. Through pictures, models and information they learned how tiny corals give shelter to many creatures. They started to see how marine life is important not just for the sea, but for the whole Earth.

1. Why do you think life under the sea is just as important as life in the forests?

2. How do you think the coral reef helps the fish and other sea creatures?

Before they left the island, they heard about North Sentinel Island. “Here people live like the ancient hunter-gatherers,” Rani told us. “They do not want visitors, so no one is allowed to go there”, said Rani. In 2004, a tsunami hit the region but they survived, possibly by noticing signs in nature like changes in the wind, sea and behaviour of animal. Their deep connection with nature might have helped them stay safe.

Before this trip, Shanti had only seen islands on television. Now, after visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, she had learned so much. Islands are full of wonders, and they need our care and respect.

Amma said that they would be going from Vijaya Puram by ship to Kolkata and from there to the Sundarbans.

“Sundarbans is a different kind of forest”, said Amma. “Something you have never seen.” she added This made Shanti so curious that she could not wait to get there.


## Sundarbans: Home of the Mangroves

After a short stop in Kolkata, they reached the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world. This forest is seen where the river Ganga meets the sea, and the land is muddy and salty. Special trees called mangroves grow in this wet and salty land.

“Those are the roots of the mangroves which help them breathe in the muddy salt water”, he answered.

Mangroves are important because their roots hold the soil together and help stop waves from washing the land away. Many people here live close to the forest and depend on it for their daily needs. For generations, they have lived in harmony with the nature.

“Why would someone wear a mask on the back of their head?”, Shanti asked curiously.

## Northeast India: Green Hills and Great Traditions

After leaving the Sundarbans, Shanti and her family began their journey towards the Northeast of India.

“Did you know that the seven states called the ‘Seven Sisters’, along with the state of Sikkim, makes up what we call the Northeast India?”, Appa asked. “Oh, yes! I remember this from class”, Shanti replied excitedly.

“What are they? How are these made>?”, Shanti asked their new guide, Chandan.

“Those are the living root bridges. The roots of these trees across the streams became strong enough to walk on. We just have to look after them now’, said Chandan.

As they explored the islands and the Northeast, they saw many amazing plants and animals. “Appa, what makes these places so special?”, Shanti asked.

Appa smiled and said, “Many of the plants and animals found here are not found anywhere else in the world! That’s what makes this one of nature’s special places—a kind of nature’s hotspot. Now, Il take you to another hotspot in our country”.

“Do you remember reading about the Indian Giant Squirrel in Grade 4? It lives in the other place we are going next”.


## Western Ghats

Appa said, “We are now heading to another mountain range, the Western Ghats, a long chain of forested hills known for its rich plant and animal life”.

1. Look at the map, locate the Western Ghats and name the six states it passes through.

2. What animals can you spot in the forest?

4. Why do you think forts were built on hilltops instead of flat land?

“The lion-tailed macaques are only found here”, Appa told. Like in the islands, some animals and birds are found only in this region.

“Do you know that several rivers of India begin from these hills?”, said Appa.

These hills have many plants that are used in traditional medicine. Many of these plants grow only in this region. Many tribal communities and other forest-dwelling people have lived here for generations. They depend on the forest and its plants for food, medicine and their livelihood.

Just then, Shanti saw a group of students with notebooks and cameras under a tree. “What are they doing?”, she asked.

“These students are part of a survey. With help from schools, farmers and experts, we found and recorded over 200 types of mangoes in the Western Ghats! Now, we are also looking at jackfruit and jamun’, explained Satish, a researcher who was guiding the students.

Shanti was amazed.

“Can I do something like this for the trees and fruits in my place too?”, she wondered.

Appa said, “Let me also tell you about the Silent Valley National Park. It is a wonderful rainforest in Kerala, home to many rare plants and animals. Unlike other rainforests, which receive a lot of rain and are usually buzzing with the sound of cicada insects; this rainforest was silent giving the valley its name”.

Appa continued, “Long ago, a dam was planned here, which would have flooded this special forest. But people from all over—villagers, students, scientists—joined together in the ‘Save Silent Valley Movement’. Their love for nature helped stop the dam. Today, the Silent Valley remains a protected forest, showing how people can save forests when they care enough to act together”.

Our hills are full of life, stories and surprises. From tiny herbs to great rivers, and from rare animals to the people—everything is connected. We need to understand and protect these places, and their connections.

From coral reefs in the sea to root bridges in the hills and the spice-filled forests of the ghats, every place has something special to teach us. Each region is home to its own wildlife, trees, people and wonders of nature. People live differently in various regions, but everywhere, they depend on nature and care for it in their own way.

Their journey showed us how rich, beautiful and connected our country truly is. If we want these wonders to stay for the future, we must alldo our part by learning, respecting and protecting the land we call home.

This unit at the preparatory stage aims to familiarise students with various things around them—how things work and how things are made. In Grades 3 and 4, students have engaged with local toys like (spinners and paper boats) to understand how they work. They have also learned about how things are made by exploring the processes of bricks, paper, etc.

While making things with locally available materials students learn useful methods of — sustainable development, including refuse,

things with their own hands, they develop a deeper appreciation for the materials we use in everyday life, and also learn to connect and care for their environment.

In Grade 5, this unit invites students to explore how everyday things, like energy and cloth, are made and used. Through simple activities and local examples, they learn how energy enables movement and light, how threads become fabric, and why reusing things and clean energy matter. It helps them see the unseen processes behind familiar things in their homes and surroundings.

What makes these things move, shine, make a sound or get warm and cold?

As you know, the Sun gives us light and heat. Around us, things move, light up, make sounds, or get warmer or cooler. Something makes this all happen—we call that energy.

Energy is what makes things move, light up, produce sound, do work and change temperature.

We use energy every day in so many ways, to make things move, produce sounds or do work, sometimes

The teacher asked the class, “Did all of you eat your breakfast this morning?”. Everyone replied, “Yes!”.

Then the teacher said, “Letus doan activity — stand up and stretch your arms. Now, jump! Run in place.”

“How are you able to move?”, she questioned.

“We are able to move because of energy.” All students replied.

The teacher continued, “How do you feel when you are hungry? When we do not eat, we may feel tired, and when we eat, we feel active and ready to play. What do you think could be the reason? This is because the food we eat gives us the energy we need”.

Now, let us think about animals. A dog running, a bird flying... just like us, animals also need energy to move, fly, swim, run, find food and protect themselves.

But from where do they get this energy?

They get it from food too. Food is a source of energy for all living things.

We use fuel in our homes too. Cooking gas is a fuel. In some places, people use wood or coal to cook food. But burning wood or coal creates smoke and pollution, so we must use it carefully.


## Discuss

1. What kind of fuel do you use at home for cooking? 2. What are the problems using too much wood or coal?


## Activity 4


## Understanding How Fuel Works

1. Place two diyas (lamps) on a flat surface.

2. In Diya 1—place a cotton wick without any oil, and in Diya 2—place a cotton wick and pour some oil around it.


## . Light the wicks in both the diyas under adult supervision.

. Observe what happens to the diyas. (a) Which diya burns longer? Why? (b) What is acting as a fuel here?

## Energy — How Things Work

Chapter 7.indd 121 10-Jul-25 [5l44:45 PM |

What would your day be like if there was no electricity at all?

Our lives have become so easy with electricity. Not only our homes and schools, but many industries also use electricity to run machines. They help produce many things that we need—like clothes, toys, books, food, and even the scooters or cars that we use!

Electricity is very useful, but it can also be dangerous if it is not used carefully.

\ Do you know? W

Energy efficiency means using less energy to do the same work. This helps save resources and reduce waste. For example, using LED bulbs instead of incandescent or fluorescent bulbs gives the same amount of light, but uses less electricity.


## Safe Use of Electricity

Do not touch wires or parts of electrical devices when they are plugged in.

¢ Do not put your fingers or other things such as, pens or sticks into electrical sockets.

e If you see broken wires or fallen electric poles, stay away and tell an adult about it immediately!


## ¢ Don’t play near electric boxes or transformers.

¢ If something looks unsafe or strange, do not try

to fix it yourself; always tell an adult!


## P[JO\A SNOJPUOA\ ANE

| Chapter{indd 122 10-Jul-25 5:44:45 PM

Most of the electricity we use comes from burning fuels like coal. However, burning coal creates a lot of smoke and harmful gases that pollute the air. This polluted air is not good for our health and the environment.

Nevertheless, there are other sources we can use to produce electricity that do not cause pollution. Can you find out what these sources are?

Ancient ships had massive sails that used wind energy to travel across the vast seas. Long ago, traders from places like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu sailed to Africa, Arabia, and Southeast Asia using the power of the wind.

The pinwheel rotated, the paper burned and the water wheel spun—all these activities show us that the wind, the Sun, and water are sources of energy that make things work.

Solar panels capture sunlight and turn it into electricity. Windmills spin with the wind to make electricity. Fast-moving rivers or falling water can also be used to generate electricity.

Electricity generated using natural sources of energy like wind, water or the Sun’s energy, does not pollute the planet with smoke or waste, and is called clean energy.

e Prepare paper slips with names or pictures of energy sources: the Sun, wind, water, food, fuel and electricity. The second paper slips should indicate types of energy, like heat, light, movement and sound. The last paper slips should contain the uses or examples of where this energy is used—drying clothes, lighting a bulb, turning a turbine, cooking, running, etc.


## Step 1: Assigning a Role

Give each student one card, where they will either be:


## « A-source of energy (the Sun, wind, etc.)


## e« Type of energy (heat, light, etc.)

¢ Use (for example, helps plants grow, moves a car, etc.) Step 2: Walk Around and Find Your Match

Students should walk around the class trying to find the two others who complete their energy chain.


## For example:


## « Sun — 3 Heat — Helps dry clothes

=0 Wind > =) Movement — © Turns turbine to make electricity Step 3: Present to Class

Once matched (source—type—use), each group should quickly explain their match to the class, for example, “We are the heat of the Sun and we help to dry clothes.”

Our body stores energy for future use. We can still run or walk even if we skip a meal because our body uses the stored energy. Have you ever used a torch or a toy that uses batteries? Batteries contain stored energy.

Energy is what makes our world active and alive. From humans and animals using food to move, to vehicles using fuel, and electricity lighting up our homes—energy is at work everywhere! We get clean energy from the Sun, wind and water which does not harm or pollute the Earth. Now, we understand where energy comes from and how it helps us. Let us use and save

Vaastu Shastra, the ancient Indian system of design and architecture, helps plan buildings in harmony with nature. It guides the placement of rooms, doors, and windows to make the best use of natural energy like sunlight, wind and heat. Open spaces like courtyards and well-placed openings help homes stay bright, airy and reduce the use of energy in different seasons.

The male baya weaver is a weaverbird, who builds beautiful hanging nests from grass. They weave the strands over and under to make the nest strong. The nest is shaped like a pouch and hangs from the branches of a tree. The expert weaverbird weaves very fine nests, while the young ones who are just learning make rather rough ones.

Weaving combines strips or threads of a material into a patterned fabric like cloth. One set of thread is placed vertically and the other goes horizontally. When these threads are carefully crossed over and under each other, they form a unified fabric such as a mat, a basket or many other things.

For a long time, people have been weaving many kinds of natural materials into mats, baskets or sheets from coconut fibre or palm reeds, bamboo, grass, jute and cotton or silk.

10-Jul-25 6:18:11 PM


## Discuss

Have you seen products woven out of natural material at home or elsewhere? What are they?

. Take 5-6 strips of blue paper and tape them at the top of a surface. 2. Take another set of yellow paper strips and weave them through— over, under, over, under. 3. Keep repeating until you get a mat. 4. Can you use this method to make a basket?

## Traditions of Weaving

People in India knew how to weave even 4,000 years ago! Traditional weaving is done by hand on an instrument called loom. The cloth made this way is called the handloom fabric. India has some of the best handloom weavers, who are experts at their craft.

™“ There are many handloom traditions in India, each with its unique technique and pattern like Kanjeevaram from Tamil Nadu, Pashmina from Kashmir, and Ikat from Odisha and Gujarat.

Weaving is not just about making clothes. It also provides work to many families, and keeps our traditional skills and designs alive. That is why weaving is so special for India—both for its culture and for the people who depend on it for their livelihood.

Textile mills use modern machines to spin thread and weave cloth in large quantities.


## Thread

We have seen how threads can be woven together to form a cloth. But how are threads made?


## Activity 3

This process of twisting cotton fibres together to make thread or yarn is called spinning. A charkha or spinning wheel, helps to spin the thread from cotton, just like the pencil does.

This thin hair-like thread you get when untwisting the cotton strand is called a fibre.

\

Do you know?

We do not get fibres only from cotton. There are many other natural sources too.


## Natural fibres


## Bamboo Cotton Linen Wool Silk

Silk comes from the cocoon of a small insect called the silk moth. The cocoons are put in hot water, the silk thread is gently pulled out, and then made into thread that is used to make silk fabric.


## Note to the Teacher

The teacher may arrange a visit to a textile mill or a place where handloom cloth is made. Otherwise, the teacher may invite a local handloom weaver to the school.

## Note to the Teacher

This unit consists of two chapters. Chapter 9 ‘Rhythms of Nature’ and Chapter 10 ‘Earth: Our Shared Home’.


## Chapter 9: Rhythms of Nature

‘Rhythms of Nature’ helps students observe and understand the natural rhythms of change in the world around them—day and night, seasons, and how plants, animals, people and places transform over time. Through journaling, activities and reflection, it encourages students to connect deeply with their local environment and notice repeating patterns in nature.


## Chapter 10: Earth— Our Shared Home

This chapter helps students see the Earth as aconnected, living planet where people, animals, plants, and ideas travel, mix and grow together. Through stories, it shows how we share nature, knowledge, and culture across borders. It brings alive the idea of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ fostering care, respect, and a sense of belonging to our shared planet.


## How to Facilitate

Encourage students to observe their surroundings like seasonal changes,

the arrival of birds or butterflies, flowers, or changes in weather. Use journals and charts to help them track and reflect on these observation.

Take students outside the classroom to the school ground, garden, or nearby pond, to explore real-life patterns in nature.

Ask simple critical thinking questions like, “Where did this come from?” or “Why do we all use it?” to spark curiosity.

Use mapping, drawing, posters, and globe-based activities to help students trace how things travel across the Earth.

Compare seasonal experiences from different parts of India (for example, winter in Kashmir vs. Kerala) to deepen their understanding of local diversity.

Help students see that we all share the same Earth and are part of one big family— ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’.

Let us understand with one simple game.


## Activity 1

Let one student be the ‘Sun’ and another the ‘arth’ standing at a distance. The Sun stands at the centre.

Let the student playing ‘Earth’ stand in one place and slowly turn around (rotate). As long as the student sees the ‘Sun’, they keep saying—“day...day...day”, looking straight ahead. When the student stops seeing the ‘Sun’ they keep saying “night... night... night”.

Now, let us do this activity using a torch and a globe.


## Demonstration — Day and Night

Step 1: Place a globe on a table and flash a torch on one side of the globe. The torchlight represents the Sun. The side where the light falls has day, and the side with no light has night.

Step 2: Rotation—Slowly rotate the globe while keeping the torch steady.

Step 3: Observe how different parts of our globe face the light as it rotates.

A globe is a model that represents our Earth. It is shaped like a ball, just like the real Earth. The blue part of the globe are the seas and oceans; they cover about three-fourth part of the Earth. Seas are usually smaller than ocean and are partly enclosed by land, while the oceans are vast and open water bodies. The remaining parts are the land masses, where we have all the countries.

Study the globe and write in the space given below, when it is day time in India, which countries will have night?

## Changes Around Us in a Year (Seasons)

Seasons’ Journal Saba and Aparna are sitting in the school garden, looking at their seasons’ journal.

You also have been looking closely at the world around you over the year and making observations in your journal.

## Rhythms of Nature

Now, it is time to record your own observations. Let us do it together, just like Saba and Aparna!


## Classroom Activity — Seasons’ Chart

All year long, you have been curious explorers of nature, observing plants, animals, sunlight, water and human activities. Now, it is time to bring all your learning together and understand the patterns of change that happen throughout the year.


## Step 1: Making a Chart for Classroom

Let us begin by preparing a large wall-sized chart in your classroom to note the observations from our journals. This will help us bring all our observations on one chart so we can see the full picture!

The chart will have the following time periods: April-June, July-September, October-December, and January-March marked in columns. The themes: plant life, birds and animals, air, heat and light, water and water bodies, and human activities listed in rows.

## Step 2: Fill the Chart

For each of the boxes (for example, April to June for plant life) one of you can stand up and ask for observations from the class. Each of you may share your observations from your journal. Discuss and write the main observations on the chart.

## PIIOA\ SNOIPUOAA INE

The next student can stand up to fill the next box in a similar way. This way, all your observations will be on your chart in the classroom. Now, the chart is ready for everyone to see and learn.

Step 3: Tracking Changes in a Year It is time to take a closer look at the patterns of change you have noticed throughout the year.

Let us form five groups. Each group can choose one theme from the chart and study the patterns of change observed across different time periods during the year.


## Group 1: ® Plant life

Group 2: & Birds and animals Group 3: O: Air, heat and light Group 4: 6) Water and water bodies Group 5: R Human activities

Create a poster on your theme. Present how your theme changed throughout the year. Be creative!

For example ® Group 1 will show how plants changed in different months—like leaves, flowers or fruits. O Group 4 can show how ponds, puddles or rain changed in different months.


## Once ready, present your poster to the class.

10-Jul-25 5:59:24 PM


## Chapter 9.indd 155


## Step 4: Looking at the Year Together

Once all the groups have made their presentations, form new groups. Make sure that the new group has one student from each theme. Form 4 groups, one for each time period.


## Group 1: April-June


## Group 2: July-September


## Group 3: October-December


## Group 4: January-March

Each group will now analyse the observations on the chart across all five themes for their chosen time period.

Use these observations to create ashort story about your time period (for example, January-March), linking what you saw in nature with what you have noticed in people’s lives. Read it out in the class.


## Discovering Seasons

We have seen how plants change, how animals behave, how the air feels, what happens with water and what people do throughout the year. You now know that nature changes slowly over the year. The weather warms up, gets hot and then it rains, and then it gets cooler before warming up again. We observed these changes throughout the year, but do you think the same things happened last year too? Will they happen again the next year?

Yes! These changes follow a pattern, a natural rhythm that repeats itself every year. This repeating pattern in nature is what we call seasons.

What are the seasons called in your region?

Winter in Kerala is different from winter in Kashmir valley. Monsoon in Assam is different from Rajasthan. Why do you think it is so?


## Celebrating Seasons

In India, we have many songs associated with seasons. Do you know any? Find out some songs.

Farmers grow different crops in different seasons. Some crops grow best in winter, while some grow best in the heat of summer. Some are planted in the rainy seasons because they need more water to grow.

With the help of your teacher and elders, name the crops that grow in summer and winter in your region.

Every season brings something special and has its own magic. Seasons are not just changes in weather; they shape everything around us. We have seen that seasons help us know how plants grow, how animals live, what people eat, wear and do. From the crops we harvest to the festivals we celebrate; seasons give rhythm to our lives and remind us that change is natural, and necessary.

In this way, seasons not only shape what we do, but also teach us about the cycles of life. By understanding the seasons, we understand how life moves in cycles. As you step out each day, you are witnessing nature’s rhythm unfolding, one season at a time.

Let us reflect — a 1. Narrate your experiences about the season changes.

2. Ask your family members and write about seasons. Do you find any major differences in the patterns or changing seasons? What could be possible reasons for these differences?

3. Seasons have local names. Find out and write the seasons mentioned below are called in your region, and your local language.

## The Blue Planet

“After seeing the Earth from outside the first thought that came to mind was that, the Earth looks completely one, no border is visible from outside. It seems that no border exists, no state exists, no countries exist. We all are part of humanity and the Earth is our one home, and all of us are in it.” These were the inspiring words shared by Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian to reach the International Space Station, during his conversation with the then Prime Minister of India.

When we look at the Earth from far above, we do not see borders or lines between countries. Nature has no boundaries—so air, water, clouds, and even seeds and animals move freely across the world.

People around the world are also connected in many ways. Just as people across India share mangoes, rivers, and festivals, people across the world are also linked by the things we share. The clothes we wear, the food we eat, and the toys we play with may have come from different parts of the world. Ideas, food, music, stories, and inventions are also shared.

Everything is linked through nature, trade, travel, and the ways we care for our planet together. Earth is our shared home.

We will explore this through some stories.

## Story 1: The Travelling Birds!

Have you seen pink and black birds flying in big groups? Those are rosy starlings! Every winter, they fly thousands of kilometres from the southern part of Russia, Mongolia and _ nearby countries to India.

These birds enjoy the warm weather in India and feed on _ locusts and grasshoppers, thus, helping farmers by eating the pests on the crops. Is it not amazing that sucha small bird can travel so far and be so helpful?

When animals move freely and safely across the world, it shows how deeply nature is connected across the globe.

Story 2: Yoga—India’s Gift to the World!

Since ancient times, people in India have practised yoga to keep their bodies healthy and their minds peaceful. It was a way to live in harmony with oneself and nature. Did you know that yoga has been practised in India for more than 3,000 years?

Spices like pepper and cardamom from India went to many countries. Traders

called them ‘black gold’ and travelled far to get them.

As time went on, travellers, scholars and teachers from India shared yoga with the world. Slowly, people in other countries began to learn and practise it too. Today, yoga is practised in almost every country.

## Story 3: Chilli—A Spice that Changed our Lives!

Long ago, chilli plants were found only in South America, far away from India. However, 400 to 500 years ago, travellers from Portugal brought chillies with them from South America to India. The chillies found new soil, a new climate and entered Indian kitchens. And guess what? People in India loved it so much that today we cannot imagine our food without chillies! Before the arrival of chilli, we used black pepper to spice up our food.

2. Potatoes, tomatoes, peanuts, cashews, and many other foods have similar stories. They all travelled a long way to reach India and now we enjoy these every day in our food. Find out and write the story of any one of them.

Story 4: The Sweet Story of Sugar! Just as chillies travelled to India, sugar travelled from India to other parts of the world.

Long ago, people across the world did not know about sugar. They used honey and other naturally

sweet things to add sweetness to their food. It was in India that the method of making jaggery from sugarcane juice was first discovered. Over time, we found a way to make jaggery into sugar.

This knowledge and technique spread to other parts of the world through trade and travel.

Did you know that even rice, mangoes and bananas from India found their way to other lands? Today, people from all over the world enjoy these gifts, but their journey began right here in India.

Our meals are like world travellers, carrying stories and flavours from all around the globe. This shows us how deeply we are all connected.

## Story 5: The Mexican Marigold Moves into India!

Did you know that the marigold flower is from Mexico? In Mexican culture, marigolds are special flowers used during festivals. From there, the marigold travelled across the world and to India, where it found a new home. Perhaps it was the bright orange and yellow colours that we loved so much as it reminded us of our sense of warmth, celebration, and spirituality. Today, marigolds are seen everywhere in India—in temples, homes, weddings, and festivals like Diwali.

All people, animals, trees, rivers, and even the air and sky belong to this family. We live together, depend on each other, and share the same home—our Earth.

When we see the world as one family, we learn to live with respect, care, and love for one another, and for the Earth that supports us all. That is what ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam?’ teaches us.

Earth is truly special. It is the only planet we know that has life! For thousands of years, it has supported people, animals, and plants.

Earth needs care too. When we care for the Earth, we are caring for each other because we are all part of the same family.

Earth is not just our home. It is a gift we must protect, for ourselves, for others, and for the future.
