He lived a simple life, wearing plain clothes and eating very little, but his smile and loving words made everyone feel special. One day, a curious young boy named Naren came to meet him. Ramakrishna saw something special in Naren and became his teacher. He taught Naren about courage, kindness, and how to find peace within.
