Its content comprises projects related to three work forms— life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking, and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders.
