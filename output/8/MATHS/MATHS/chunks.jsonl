Though Al-Khwarizmi’s work on calculation with Hindu numerals was translated into Latin, it was the Italian mathematician Fibonacci who around the year 1200 really made the case to Europe to adopt the Indian numerals. However, the Roman numerals were so ingrained in European thinking and writing at the time that the Indian numerals did not gain widespread use for several more centuries. But eventually, during the European Renaissance and by the 17th century, not adopting them became impossible or it would impede scientific progress.", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}

The first explicit statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of the property for multiplication as khanda-gunanam (multiplication by parts). His verse states, “The multiplier is broken up into two or more parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by each of these and the results added”. That is, if there are two parts, then using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c= ac+ be. In the next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method for doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we explore further in the next section.", "element_type": "NarrativeText"}
