The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pafichakoshas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages.

The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It aims to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India— to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks are intended to play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy’s role that helps strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook of mathematics for Grade 8 (Part 1) is designed to make learning fun, engaging, and meaningful. Aligned with NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, the textbook continues to foster the spirit of experiential and inquiry-based learning, a spirit already introduced in the mathematics textbooks for Grades 6 and 7. It encourages students to ask questions, think critically, and understand concepts of mathematics through real-world contexts.

The textbook makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content is structured in a way that supports a joyful and progressive understanding of increasingly complex concepts, easing students into more advanced learning. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas, such as Science, Social Science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). At most of the places the concept begins with either a story or a puzzle that not only makes students think but also feels the importance of the concept.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem-solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics contributes to the development of capacities to make informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus plays an important role in achieving the overall aims of school education.

Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and performs the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment ofa learner and being abstract. It performs the role of developing intuition, while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It is enhancing critical and logical thinking, while also developing artistry and creativity, and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Mathematics provides students with plenty of opportunities to explore and discover concepts on their own while also teaching the best-known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics.

This textbook attempts to address the goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods in helping students to develop both intuition and rigour. The textbook also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student-teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the textbook to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open-ended to stimulate classroom discussion.

The Chapter 1: ‘A Square and A Cube’ is an introduction to the special types of numbers called squares and cubes through engaging explorations, and contexts. Chapter 2: ‘Power Play’ considers short and logical ways of expressing very large numbers, and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3: ‘A Story of Numbers’ reveals how the idea of number and number representation evolved over the course of time, across different places in the world, to finally reach its modern efficient form. Chapter 4: ‘Quadrilaterals’ discusses some interesting types of four-sided figures and problems based on them. Chapter 5: ‘Number Play’ shows different properties of numbers studied by the students with a balance of engaging activities

through visualisation and rigorous mathematical reasoning. Chapter 6: ‘We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply’ covers aspects related to Algebra, and in particular, the distributive law. Chapter 7: ‘Proportional Reasoning’ explores a new way to compare two quantities using daily life situations. In all the chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History and Science.

By weaving storytelling and hands-on activities together, as done in Grades 6 and 7, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give students the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other and provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about the underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage students to find many different ways to solve problems.

As per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, computational thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage students on these aspects. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have also been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics.

The concepts and problems in this textbook are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials that students are familiar with. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used in the classroom. Exercises or activities are often given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. However, this textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom.

We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters, to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers can revise these concepts in a spiralling way so that students are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may focus more on the ideas of squares and cubes, exponents, evolution of numbers and other notions that are new to the students, and are foundational for further learning.

Finally, this textbook aims to be more than just a textbook—it is a passport to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration. Whether used in the classroom or at home, we hope that it inspires


## vi

students to embark on their own mathematicaladventures, empowering them to see the beauty and relevance of Mathematics in everything. With its engaging approach and comprehensive coverage of Grade 8 mathematics concepts, this textbook aims to captivate young minds and set them on a lifelong journey of mathematical discovery.

Ionce again thank all the writers of and contributors of this textbook for their valuable contribution and service to the nation’s mathematics teachers, learners and enthusiasts.

We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding the textbook and hope that you will send interesting exercises, activities and tasks that you may develop while teaching and learning for future editions.

We hope that this book, Ganita Prakash, will serve as a strong support and guide to you in achieving the exciting task that you have before you: that of passing on the joy of learning the beautiful subject of Mathematics to the next generation.

This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms,where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms needto be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions.

Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups.

Along withit,anenvironmentthataccepts mistakes andacknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.

While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics.

It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students.

To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this book are marked using the icons 2 and . These icons are indicators of potential opportunities to start off a process of problem-solving and exploration a the classroom. You will find some

of the problems labelled (ai ) °. Such questions can especially be

made as topics for classroom discussion.

An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problem- solving approaches. These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations.

In this grade, justification/proofs of mathematical statements find an increased presence. Students should be gently encouraged to deduce properties and not be forced to do it. Whenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and observe, and use their intuition in figuring out properties. Providing justification/ proof is a skill that takes time to develop.

To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to ‘cover’ all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them.

It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration.

Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting word problems.

This textbook contains a number of open-ended problems. It also contains new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to solve them or follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay! Not everyone knows everything. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content,it will be very useful to take it to the classroom and open it up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. This process itself can throw a lot of light on the content.

In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them.

It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful time using this textbook!

## Summary of Key Points


## Time for Exploration

1.

It is important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns, or challenges to the students and give them sufficient time to play with, discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups.

During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.

There should be a culture where students pose problems to each other and discuss with each other various ways to approach the problems.


## About the Problems in the Book

1.

The exploratory problems in the book not only promote problem solving; they also aim to strengthen procedural fluency when students start engaging in exploration.

Trying to ‘cover’ all the problems in the book must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with, discussing, and solving them.


## Reading

1.

2.

Encourage students to read the book by themselves and in groups.

Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and to express it to others.


## Right of Not Knowing!

1.

It is perfectly okay if some of the content is not understood immediately. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, it can also be taken to the classroom and opened up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them!

Learning is a continual process. Indeed, there is so much in mathematics thatis stillnot known and requires further exploration!

To be able to appreciate the art of mathematics, it is not enough to just be a passive spectator. You need to immerse yourself in its process like a detective getting into action to solve a mystery.

This is especially required when you see a new question or when a question arises from your own sense of wonder, or when you come across a new beautiful pattern. When you encounter these, pause your reading, and use your creativity to work out the question or understand and appreciate the pattern.

You will find that some questions are accompanied by their answers. Even if this is the case, it is worthwhile to work on the problems by yourself or in a group before you see the answer.

This will enrich your experience of going through the book! Whenever there are questions coming up, you will see the icon @ and (2). This indicates that it is time for figuring things out! @ indicates a main question and ?) indicates a sub-question. and

The icons for owls suggest some important

be discussed and worked out with your peers.

Finally, there are questions marked . These questions

Queen Ratnamanjuri had a will written that described her fortune of ratnas (precious stones) and also included a puzzle. Her son Khoisnam and their 99 relatives were invited to the reading of her will. She wanted to leave all of her ratnas to her son, but she knew that if she did so, all their relatives would pester Khoisnam forever. She hoped that she had taught him everything he needed to know about solving puzzles. She left the following note in her will—

“I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it at the same time, you will share the ratnas equally. However, if you are the first one to solve the problem, you will get to keep the entire inheritance to yourself. Good luck.”

The minister took Khoisnam and his 99 relatives to a secret room in the mansion containing 100 lockers.

The minister explained— “Each person is assigned a number from 1 to 100.

¢ Person 1 opens every locker.

¢ Person 2 toggles every 2nd locker (i.e., closes it if it is open, opens it if it is closed).

Person 3 toggles every 3rd locker (3rd, 6th, 9th, ... and so on).

¢ Person 4 toggles every 4th locker (4th, 8th, 12th, ... and so on).

This continues until all 100 get their turn. In the end, only some lockers remain open. The open lockers reveal the code to the fortune in the safe.”

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Ifa locker is toggled an odd number of times, it will be open. Otherwise, it will be closed. The number of times a locker is toggled is the same as the number of factors of the locker number. For example, for locker #6, Person 1 opens it, Person 2 closes it, Person 3 opens it and Person 6 closes it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are factors of 6. If the number of factors is even, the locker will be toggled by an even number of people and it will eventually be closed.

Note that each factor of a number has a ‘partner factor’ so that the product of the pair of factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and 6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3 form another pair.

?) Does every number have an even number of factors?

4: ils 1x1 ri me only fattar Factors are ss’ 1,2 and 4.

We see in some cases, like 2 x 2, that the numbers in the pair are the

same. ?) Can you use this insight to find more numbers with an odd number of


## factors?

For instance, 36 has a factor pair 6 x 6 where both numbers are 6. Does this number have an odd number of factors? If every factor of 36 other than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure that 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true.

Hence all the following numbers have an odd number of factors — 1x1,2*2,3x3,4x4,...

A number that can be expressed as the product of a number with itself is called a square number, or simply a square. The only numbers that have an odd number of factors are the squares, because they each have one factor which, when multiplied by itself, equals the number. Therefore, every locker whose number is a square will remain open.

®

‘Khoisnam immediately collects word clues from these 10 lockers and , reads, “The passcode consists of the first five locker numbers that were touched exactly twice.”

Which are these five lockers?

The lockers that are toggled twice are the prime numbers, since each prime number has 1 and the number itself as factors. So, the code is \, 2-3-5-7-11.


## 1.1 Square Numbers

Why are the numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., called squares? We know that the number of unit squares in a square (the area of a square) is the product of its sides. The table below gives the areas of squares with different sides.


## Sidelength Area (in units) (in sq units)

88x89 sq. units pt bar tepunit |


## 5 x 5 = 25 sq. units

10 x 10 = 100 sq. units

We use the following notation for squares. 1x1==1 2x2=2?=4 3x3=3°=9, 4x4=4°=16 5x5=5*=25.

In general, for any number n, we write n x n= n’, which is read as ‘n squared’. Can we have a square of sidelength 3 or 2.5 units?

Yes, there area in square units are @y = e) x e) = ), and (2.5) = (2.5) x (2.5) = 6.25.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

The squares of natural numbers are called perfect squares. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... are all perfect squares. Patterns and Properties of Perfect Squares

Find the squares of the first 30 natural numbers and fill in the table below.

"

?) If a number ends in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9, is it always a square? Math

The numbers 16 and 36 are both squares with 6 in the units place. 1 However, 26, whose units digit is also 6, is not a square. Therefore, we cannot determine if a number is a square just by looking at the digit in the units place. But, the units digit can tell us when a number is not a square. If a number ends with 2, 3, 7, or 8, then we can definitely say that it is not a square.

Write 5 numbers such that you can determine by looking at their units digit that they are not squares.

The squares, 1”, 9, 117, 19”, 217, and 29”, all have 1 in their units place. Write the next two squares. Notice that if a number has 1 or 9 in the units place, then its square ends in 1.

Let us consider square numbers ending in 6: 16 = 4’, 36 = 6’, 196 = 14’, 256 = 16”, 576 = 24’, and 676 = 26’.

Find more such patterns by observing the numbers and their squares from the table you filled earlier.

Consider the following numbers and their squares.

But we have two zeroes.

We have one zero.

100° = 10000 We have 200? = 40000 But we have two zeroes. 700? = 49000 four zeroes. 900° = 81000

If a number contains 3 zeros at the end, how many zeros will its square have at the end?

What do you notice about the number of zeros at the end of a number and the number of zeros at the end of its square? Will this always happen? Can we say that squares can only have an even number of zeros at the end?

? What can you say about the parity of a number and its square?


## Perfect Squares and Odd Numbers

Let us explore the differences between consecutive squares. What do you notice?

4-1=3 9-4=5 16-9=7 25-16=9 See if this pattern continues for the next few square numbers.

From this we observe that adding consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 gives consecutive square numbers, as shown below.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Do you remember this pattern from Grade 6? The picture below explains why each subsequent inverted L gives the next odd number:


## ms RS fo

1+3 1+3+(3+2) 1+3+5 1+34+5+(5+2) 14+34+5+7

We see that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n’. Alternatively, every square is a sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1.

In mathematics, sometimes arguments and reasoning can be presented without any words. Visual proofs can be complete by themselves.

Also, we can find out whether a number is a perfect square by successively subtracting odd numbers. Consider the number 25, successively subtract 1, 3, 5, ... until you get or cross over 0,

25-1=24 24-3=21 24— 5= 16 16“ 9 9-9=0

This means 25 = 1+3+5+7+9 and is thus a perfect square. Since we subtracted the first five odd numbers, 25 = 5”.

2 Using the pattern above, find 36’, given that 35’= 1225.

From the question we know that 1225 is the sum of the first 35 odd numbers. To find 36”, we need to add the 36th odd number to 1225. ?) How do we find the 36th odd number? The 1st odd number is 1, 2nd odd number is 3, 3rd number is 5, ..., 6th odd number is 11 and so on. ?) What is the n“ odd number? The n™ odd number is 2n-1. Therefore, the 36th odd number is 71. By adding 71 to 1225, we get 1296, which is 36”. Consider a number such as 38 that is not a square and subtract consecutive odd numbers starting from 1.

38-1=37 37-3=34 34-5=29 29-7=22 22-9=13 13-11=20 0 2-13=-11

This shows that 38 cannot be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd

(6) numbers starting with 1. 6


## A Square and A Cube

Thus, we can say that a natural number is not a perfect square if it cannot be expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers starting from 1. We can use this result to find out whether a natural number is a perfect square.

2 Find how many numbers lie between two consecutive perfect squares. Do you notice a pattern?

?) How many square numbers are there between 1 and 100? How many are between 101 and 200? Using the table of squares you filled earlier, enter the values below, tabulating the number of squares in each block of 100. What is the largest square less than 1000?

1-100 101-200 201-300 301-400 401 —500

## Square Roots

2 The area of a square is 49 sq. cm. What is the length of its side? We know that 7 x 7 = 49, or 7” = 49.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

So, the length of the side of a square with an area of 49 sq. cm is 7 cm.

We call 7 the square root of 49. In general, if y= x’ then x is the square root of y.

? What is the square root of 64? We know that 8 x 8 is 64. So, 8 is the square root of 64. What about

—8x-8 ? That is 64 too! 8’ = 64, and (- 8)’ = 64. So, the square roots of 64 are + 8 and-8.

Every perfect square has two integer square roots. One is positive and

the other is negative. The square root of a number is denoted by ra Thus, V64=+8 and v10! =+10,

Note that V8? =+8 and V10? =+10. In general, vn? =4n. In this chapter, we shall only consider the positive square root.

? Given a number, such as 576 or 327, how do we find out if itis a

perfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square root?

We know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even

1 a),


## Math © Talk

number of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this

condition is a square.

We can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we

cannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square.

1. We can list all the square numbers in sequence and find out whether 576 occurs among them. We know that 202 = 400, we can find squares of 21, 22, 23, ... and so on until we get 576 or a number

greater than 576. 20 = 400 21° = 441 22? = 484 23? = 529 24° = 576

However, this process becomes inefficient for larger numbers.

2. Recall that every square can be expressed as a sum of consecutive

odd numbers starting from 1. Consider 81.

81-1=80 80-3=77 77-5=72 72-7=65 65-9=56 56-11=45 45-13=32 32-15=17 17-17=0

From 81, we successively subtracted consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 until we obtained 0 at the 9th step. Therefore 81 =9.

Can we find the square root of 729 using this method? Yes, but it will be time-consuming.


## A Square and A Cube

3. We know that a perfect square is obtained by multiplying an integer by itself. Will looking at a number’s prime factorisation help in determining whether it is a perfect square?

Yes, if we can divide the prime factors of a number into two equal groups, then the product of the prime factors in either group combine to form the square root.

@ Is 324 a perfect square? 324=2x2x3x3x3x 3. These can be grouped as 324 = (2 x 3x 3) x (2x3 x 3). = (2 x 3 x 3)? = 18”, We can also write the prime factors in pairs. That is, 324 = (2 x 2) x (3 x 3) x (3 x 3), which shows that 324 is a perfect square. Thus, 324 = (2x3x3)’ = 18”. Therefore, /324 =18. (?) Is 156 a perfect square? The prime factorisation of 156 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 13. We cannot pair up these factors. Therefore, 156 is not a perfect square. ?) Find whether 1156 and 2800 are perfect squares using prime factorisation.

We can estimate the square root of larger perfect squares by looking at the closest perfect squares we are familiar with and then narrowing down the interval to search.

For example, to find /1936, we can reason as follows:

(i) 1936 is between 1600 (407) and 2500 (507), so 40 < V1936 <50.

(ii) The last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root must either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46.

(iii) If we calculate 45’, we can compare it with 1936 to halve the interval to search from 40-50 to either 40-45 or 45-50. We can write 45’ as (40 + 5) (40 + 5) = 407+ 2x 40x5+ 5? = 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025.

(iv) 2025 > 1936. So, 40 < V1936 < 45

(v) From the observation in point b we can guess and then verify that V1936 is 44. Consider the following situations —

Aribam and Bijou play a game. One says a number and the other replies with its square root. Aribam starts. He says 25, and Bijou quickly (9) 9


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

responds with 5. Then Bijou says 81, and Aribam answers 9. The game goes on till Aribam says 250. Bijou is not able to answer because 250 is not a perfect square. Aribam asks Bijou if he can at least provide a number that is close to the square root of 250.

For this, Bijou needs to estimate the square root of 250. We know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100 = 10 and ./400 = 20. So, 10 < 250 < 20.

But, we are still not very close to the number whose square is 250. We know that 15’ = 225 and 16? = 256.

Therefore, 15 < 250 < 16. Since 256 is much closer to 250 than 225, 250 is approximately 16. We also know it is less than 16.

Here is another problem that requires estimating square roots.

Akhil has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm’. He wants to know if he can cut out a square handkerchief of side 15 cm. If not, he wants to know the maximum size handkerchief that can be cut out from this piece of cloth with an integer side length.

125 is not a perfect square. The nearest perfect squares are 11? = 121 and 12? = 144. So the largest square handkerchief with integer side length that can be cut out from this piece of cloth has side length 11 cm.

? How many cubes of side 1 cm will make a cube of side 3 cm?


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Consider the numbers 1, 8, 27, ...

These numbers are called perfect cubes. Can you see why they are named so?

Each of them is obtained by multiplying a number by itself three times. We note that

1=1x1x1 8=2x2x2 27=3x3x3

?) Is 9 a cube?

We see that 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 and 3 x 3 x 3 = 27. This shows that 9 is not a perfect cube. Nor is any number from 10 to 26.

?) Can you estimate the number of unit cubes in a cube with an edge length of 4 units?

It has 64 unit cubes! If you notice carefully, each layer of this cube has 4 x 4 unit cubes. Each square layer has 16 unit cubes (4 x 4), and there are 4 such layers, so the total number of unit cubes is 4 x 4 x 4 = 64.

Since 5°=5 x5 x5-=125, 125 is a cube. In general, for any number n, we write the cube nxnxnasn’.

## Taxicab Numbers

Once when Srinivasa Ramanujan was working with G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, Hardy had come to visit Ramanujan at a hospital when he was _ ill. Hardy had ridden in a taxicab numbered 1729 and he remarked that 1729 was ‘rather a dull number,’ adding that he hoped that this was not a bad sign. Ramanujan immediately replied, “No, Hardy, it is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways”.

1729 = 1° + 123 = 9° + 10°. Because of this story, 1729 has since been known as the Hardy-

Ramanujan Number. And numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways are called taxicab numbers.

2 The next two taxicab numbers after 1729 are 4104 and 13832. Find / the two ways in which each of these can be expressed as the sum of iy,


## two positive cubes.

How did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All through his life, he tinkered with numbers. During Ramanujan’s time in Cambridge, his colleagues often marveled at his ability to see deep patterns in numbers that seemed arbitrary to others. His colleague, John Littlewood, once said, “Every positive integer was one of his [Ramanujan's] personal friends”.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Perfect Cubes and Consecutive Odd Numbers Consecutive odd numbers have a role to play with cubes too. Look at the following pattern: 1=1-=1 3+5=8=23 7+9+11=27=3° 13+15+17+19=64=4° 21+23+25+27+29=125=5% 31+ 33+ 35+37+39+ 41 =216=6°%. Later in this series, we get the following set of consecutive numbers: 91 +93 +95 +97+99 +101 + 103 + 105 + 107 + 109.

@ Can you tell what this sum is without doing the calculation?


## Cube Roots

We know that 8 = 2°. We call 2 the cube root of 8 and denote this by 2 = VB.

More generally, if y = x’, then x is the cube root of y. This is denoted by x= Vv.S0, V8 = 42° =2, Similarly, *°/27= ‘v3 =3 and */1000 = */10°=3. In general, Vn =n.

How do we find out if a number is a cube? Taking inspiration from the case of squares, let us see if we can use prime factorisations.

? Let us check if 3375 is a perfect cube. 3375 =3x3x3x5x5*x5.

Can the factors be split into three identical groups? For 3375, we can

form three groups of (3 x 5). So,

3375 = (3 x 5) x (3 x 5) x (3 x 5) = (3 x 5)? = 15%. Another way is to check if the factors can be grouped into triplet(s): 3375 = (3 x 3 x 3) x (5 x 5x5) = 3° 5, This means 73375 =15.

2 Is 500 a perfect cube?

500=2*x2*x5x5x5,. Wesee that the factors cannot be split into three identical groups. Therefore, 500 is not a perfect cube.

roots in problems involving land measurement, architectural design, and other areas where geometric calculations were necessary.

In ancient Sanskrit works the term varga was used both for the square figure or its area, as well as the square power, and the term ghana was used both for the solid cube as well as the product of a number with itself three times. The fourth power was called varga-varga . These terms were used in India at least from the third century BCE.


## Aryabhata (499 CE) states

“A square figure of four equal sides and the number representing its area are called varga. The product of two equal quantities is also called varga.”

Thus, the term varga for square power has its origin in the graphical representation of a square figure.

Why is the word ‘root’ (the root of a plant) used for the mathematical operation v (square root, cube root, etc.)?

It is because, in ancient India, the Sanskrit word mula, meaning root of a plant, basis, cause, origin, etc., was used for the mathematical operations of taking roots.

In Sanskrit, varga-mula (the basis, cause, origin of the square) was used for square-root and ghana-mula was used for cube-root. This use of mula for the mathematical concept of root was subsequently emulated in Arabic and Latin through their corresponding words for the root of a plant — jidhr and radix respectively. The term mula for root has been used in India at least from the first century BCE. Another term used was pada (foot, basis, cause, origin). Brahmagupta (628 CE) explains, ‘The pada (root) of a krti (square) is that of which it is a square.’

## An Impossible Venture!

Take a sheet of paper, as large a sheet as you can find. Fold it once. Fold it again, and again.

@ How many times can you fold it over and over?

Estu says “I heard that a sheet of paper can’t be folded more than 7 times”.

Roxie replies “What if we use a thinner paper, like a newspaper or a tissue paper?”

Try it with different types of paper and see what happens.

What! That’s crazy! Just 46 times!? You must have ignored several zeros

It might be hard to digest the fact that after just 46 folds, the thickness is more than 7,00,000 km. This is the power of multiplicative growth, also called exponential growth. Let us analyse the growth.

We have seen that the thickness doubles after every fold.

0.001 cm x 2 x 2 = 0.004 cm, or 0.001 cm x 2” = 0.004 cm (in shorthand). Upon folding it thrice, its thickness became —

0.001 cm x 2 x 2 x 2, or 0.001 cm x 2° = 0.008 cm. When folded four times, its thickness became —

0.001 cm x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, or 0.001 cm x 2* = 0.016 cm. Similarly, the expression for the thickness of the paper when folded 7

times will be 0.001 cm x 2x 2x 2x2*2*x2x2,or0.001 cm x 2’ = 0.128 cm. We have seen that square numbers can be expressed as n* and cube

Instead of a 5-digit lock, let us assume we have a 2-digit lock and try to find out how many passwords are possible.

There are 10 options for the first digit (0 to 9). For each of these, there are 10 options for the second digit (If 0 is the first digit then 00, 01, 02, 03, ..., 09 are possible). Therefore the total number of combinations for a 2-digit lock is 10 x 10 = 100.

Now, suppose we have a 3-digit lock. For each of the earlier 100 (2-digit) passwords there are 10 choices for the third digit. So, there are 100 x 10 = 1000 combinations for a 3-digit lock. You can list them all: 000, 001, 002, ....., 997, 997, 999.

How many 5-digit passwords are possible?

Each digit has 10 choices, so a 5-digit lock will have:

10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10° = 1,00,000 passwords. This is the same as writing numbers till 99,999 with all 5 digits, i-e., 00000, 00001, 00002, ...00010, 00011, ...,00100, 00101, ...,00999, ..., 30456, ..., 99998, 99999.

## Scientific Notation

Let’s look at some facts involving large numbers— Gi) The Sun is located 30,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 m from the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. (ii) The number of stars in our galaxy is 1,00,00,00,00,000. (iii) +The mass of the Earth is 59,76,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 kg.

As the number of digits increases, it becomes difficult to read the numbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place commas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting %5,000 when you were supposed to get 50,000. The number of zeroes is more important than the initial digits in several cases.

Can we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very large numbers correctly?

For example, the number 5900 can be expressed as—

5900 = 590 x 10 = 590 x 10° =59 x 100 = 59 x 10° = 5.9 x 1000 = 5.9 x 10° = 0.59 x 10000 = 0.59 x 10%.

Any number can be written as the product of a number between

1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example,

5900 = 5.9 x 10° 20800 = 2.08 x 10* 80,00,000 = 8 x 10°

@ Write the large-number facts we read just before in this form.

In scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form), we write numbers as x x 10”, where x > 1 and x < 10 is the coefficient and y, the exponent, is any integer. Often, the exponent y is more important than the coefficient x. When we write the 2 crore population of Mumbai as 2 x 10’, the 7 is more important than the 2. Indeed, if the 2 is changed to 3, the population increases by one-half, i.e., 2 crore to 3 crore, whereas if the 7 is changed to 8, the change in population is 10 times, i.e., 2 crores to 20 crores. Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the exponent, which indicates the number of digits.

If we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the impression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units place. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned about how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value. If we are only sure that the population is around 1 lakh 42 thousand, we can write it as 1.42 x 10°. If we can only be certain that it is around 1 lakh 40 thousand, we write it as 1.4 x 10°. The number of digits in the coefficient reflects how well we know the number. The most important part of any

number written in scientific form is the exponent, and then the first digit of the coefficient. The digits following the coefficient are small corrections to the first digit.

## 2.5 Did You Ever Wonder?

Last year, we looked at interesting thought experiments in the chapter on Large Numbers. Let us continue this journey.

Nanjundappa wants to donate jaggery equal to Roxie’s weight and wheat equal to Estu’s weight. He is wondering how much it would cost.

| | | |

What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated jaggery? What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated wheat?

In order to find out, let us first describe the relationships among the quantities present. Worth of jaggery (in rupees) = Roxie’s weight in kg = cost of 1 kg jaggery. Worth of wheat (in rupees) = Estu’s weight in kg x cost of 1 kg wheat. (?) Make necessary and reasonable assumptions for the unknowns and find the answers. Remember, Roxie is 13 years old and Estu is 11 years old.

Assuming Roxie’s weight to be 45 kg and the cost of 1 kg ofjaggery to be %70, the worth of donated jaggery is 45 x 70 = $3150. Assuming Estu’s weight to be 50 kg and the cost of 1 kg of wheat to be %50, the worth of donated wheat is 50 x 50 = 2500.

The practice of lear, equal to the weight of a person, called ay 7 soy

Tulabhara or Tula m, is quite old and is still followed in many places in Southe: It is a symbol of bhakti (surrendering oneself), a token of gratitude; it also supports the community.

Roxie wonders, “Instead of jaggery if we use 1-rupee coins, how many coins are needed to equal my weight?”. How can we find out?

For questions like these, you can consider following the steps suggested below.

1. Guessing: Make an instinctive (quick) guess of what the answer could be, without any calculations.


## “* Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

2. Calculating using estimation and approximation —

(i) Describe the relationships among the quantities that are needed to find the answer. (ii) Make reasonable assumptions and approximations if the required information is not available. (iii) Compute and find the answer (and check how close your guess was).

Would the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or even more? Make an instinctive guess.

(?) Find the answer by making necessary and ° reasonable assumptions and approximations for | How about measuring the unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for | °° find out the weight an exact answer but a reasonably close estimate. OLE TAS DS2 CDs

Initially, your guesses may be very far off from the answer and it is perfectly fine! You will get better at it like as you do it often and in different situations. Guessing and estimating can build intuition about numbers and various quantities.

Estu asks, “What if we use 5-rupee coins or 10-rupee notes instead? How much money could it be?”

(?) Make an instinctive guess first. Then find out (make necessary and reasonable assumptions about the unknown details and find the answers).

Estu says, “When I become an adult, I would like to donate notebooks worth my weight every year”. Roxie says, “When I grow up, I would like to do annadana (offering grains or meals) worth my weight every year”.

How many people might benefit from each of these offerings in a year? Again, guess first before finding out. Talk

Roxie and Estu overheard someone saying —‘“We did padayatra for about 400 km to reach this place! We arrived early this morning.”

eg How long ago would they have started their journey?

(?) Find answers by making necessary assumptions and approximations. Do guess first before calculating to check how close your guess was!

Note to the Teacher: Assumptions can vary greatly at times, and as a result the answers computed using these you can also vary. This is perfectly alright. Modelling the situation properly is crucial, which can also be done in different ways sometimes. The accuracy of the assumed numbers or quantities can get better with exposure and practice.

@ What do you think? Make

Padayatra, is the traditional practice of walking long distances as part of a religious or spiritual pursuit. People across religions in our country observe similar forms of pilgrimage or spiritual walking, although they may have different names or purposes.

Some of the pilgrimages are Ajmer Sharif Dargah Ziyarat, Pandharpur Wari, Kanwar Yatra, Sabarimala Yatra, Sammed Shikharji Yatra, Lumbini to Sarnath Yatra.

Before the rise of modern transport, people moved from one place to another by walking — sometimes merchants, sages, and scholars walked thousands of kilometres to different parts of the world across deserts, mountains, and rivers.

How many times can a person circumnavigate (go around the world) the Earth in their lifetime if they walk non-stop? Consider the distance around the Earth as 40,000 km.

If we calculate the value, we get the result as 1,92,20,00,000 steps, which is 192 crore and 20 lakh steps or 1 billion 922 million steps. The fixed increase in the distance from the earth with each step (a 20 cm gain after each step) is called linear growth.

To cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon, it takes 1,92,20,00,000 steps with linear growth whereas it takes just 46 folds of a piece of paper with exponential growth! Linear growth is additive, whereas exponential growth is multiplicative.

## 2.5 A Pinch of History

In the Lalitavistara, a Buddhist treatise from the first century BCE, we see number-names for odd powers of ten up to 10°. The following occurs as part of the dialogue between the mathematician Arjuna and Prince Gautama, the Bodhisattva.

“Hundred kotis are called an ayuta (10°), hundred ayutas a niyuta (10"), hundred niyutas a kankara (10%), .... hundred sarva-balas a visamjna- gati (10), hundred visamjna-gatis a sarvajna (10), hundred sarvajnas a vibhutangama (10°’), a hundred vibhutangamas is a tallakshana (10°°).”

Mahaviracharya gives a list of 24 terms (i.e., up to 10”) in his treatise Ganita-sara-sangraha. An anonymous Jaina treatise Amalasiddhi gives a list with a name for each power of ten up to 10° (dasha-ananta). A Pali grammar treatise of Kaccayana lists number-names up to 10°, named asankhyeya.

For expressing high powers of ten, Jaina and Buddhist texts use bases like sahassa (thousand) and kofti (ten million); for instance, prayuta (10°) would be dasa sata sahassa (ten hundred thousand).

The modern naming is similar to this, where we say, A hundred 100 x 1000 = 1,00,000 10? x 10% = 10° thousand is a lakh

A hundred lakhs 100 x 1,00,000 = 1,00,00,000 102 x 10° = 107

Ahundred crores 100 x 1,00,00,000 = 1,00,00,00,000 107 x 10’ =10° is an arab

A hundred arab is 100 x 1,00,00,00,000 107 x 10° = 10%? a kharab = 1,00,00,00,00,000

Continuing this, a hundred kharab is a neel (10"’), a hundred neel is a padma (10"°), a hundred padma is a shankh (10"”) and a hundred shankh is a maha shankh (10").

In the American/International system, we say

A thousand thousand 1000 x 1000 = 1,000,000 10° x 10° = 10° is a million A thousand million is 1000 x 1,000,000 = 1,000,000,000 10° x 10° = 10° a billion A thousand billion is 1000 x 1,000,000,000 10° x 10° = 10” an trillion = 1,00,000,000,000

Continuing this, a thousand trillion is a quadrillion (10°). This pattern continues. Observe the names million (105), billion (10°), trillion (107), quadrillion (10°), quintillion (10"), sextillion (10), septillion (10”), octillion (10°’), nonillion (10°), decillion (10°).

## 3.1 Reema’s Curiosity

One lazy afternoon, Reema was flipping through an old book when— whoosh!—a piece of paper slipped out and floated to the floor. She picked it up and stared at the strange symbols all over it. “What is this?” she wondered.

She ran to her father, holding the paper as if it were a secret treasure. He looked at it and smiled. “Around 4000 years ago, there flourished a civilisation in a region called Mesopotamia, in the western part of Asia, containing a major part of the present-day Iraq and a few other neighbouring countries. This is one of the ways they wrote their numbers!”


## Tt] Wo |e WH wo

Reema’s eyes lit up, “Seriously? These strange symbols were numbers?” Her curiosity was sparked, and questions started swirling in her head.

when have humans been counting?

Since when have people been writing numbers in the modern

Chapter 3.indd 48 10-07-2025 17:44:17

Sensing her curiosity, her father started telling her how the idea of number and number representation evolved over the course of time, across geographies, to finally reach its modern efficient form. Get ready to travel back in time with them!

Humans had the need to count even as early as the Stone Age. They were counting to determine the quantity of food they had, the number of animals in their livestock, details regarding trades of goods, the number of offerings given in rituals, etc. They also wanted to keep track of the passing days, e.g., to know and predict when important events such as the new moon, full moon, or onset of a season would occur. However, when they said or wrote down such numbers, they didn’t make use of the numbers that we use today.

The structure of the modern oral and written numbers that we use today had its origin thousands of years ago in India. Ancient Indian texts, such as the Yajurveda Samhita, mentioned names of numbers based on powers of 10, almost as we say them orally today. For example, they listed names for the numbers one (eka), ten (dasha), hundred (shata), thousand (sahasra), ten thousand (dayuta), etc., all the way up to 10” and beyond.

The way we write our numbers today — using the digits 0 through 9 — also originated and were developed in India, around 2000 years ago. The first known instance of numbers being written using ten digits, including the digit 0 (which was then notated as a dot), occurs in the Bakhshali manuscript (c. 3rd century CE). Aryabhata (c. 499 CE) was the first mathematician to fully explain, and do elaborate scientific computations with the 2¢r0 in the Bakhshali manuscript Indian system of 10 symbols.

The Indian number system was transmitted to the Arab world by around 800 CE. It was popularised in the Arab world by the great Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (after whom the word ‘algorithm’ is named) through his book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals (c.825) and by the noted philosopher Al-Kindi through his work On the Use of the Hindu Numerals (c. 830).

From the Arab world, the Hindu numerals were transmitted to Europe and to parts of Africa by around 1100 CE. Though Al-Khwarizmi’s work on calculation with Hindu numerals was translated into Latin, it was the Italian mathematician Fibonacci who around the year 1200 really made the case to Europe to adopt the Indian numerals. However, the Roman numerals were so ingrained in European thinking and writing at the time that the Indian numerals did not gain widespread use for several more centuries. But eventually, during the European Renaissance and by the 17th century, not adopting them became impossible or it would impede scientific progress.

“The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculations and placed arithmetic foremost among useful inventions.”


## — Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827)

Their use then spread to every continent, and are now used in every corner of the world.

Because European scholars learned the Indian numerals from the Arab world, they called them ‘Arabic numerals’ to reflect their European perspective. On the other hand, as noted above, Arab scholars, such as Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Kindi, called them ‘Hindu numerals’. During the period of European colonisation, the European term Arabic numbers became widely used. However, in recent years, this mistake is being corrected in many textbooks and documents around the world, including in Europe. The most commonly used terminologies for the numbers we use today are ‘Hindu numerals’, ‘Indian numerals’, and the transitional ‘Hindu-Arabic numerals’. It is worth noting that the word ‘Hindw’ here does not refer to a religion, but rather a geography/people from whom these numbers came.

The shape of the digits 0, 1, 2, .... 9 used to write numbers in the Indian number system today evolved over a period of time, as shown below:

@ Q1. How do we ensure that all cows have returned safely after

@ Q2. Do we have fewer cows than our neighbour?

@ Q3. If there are fewer, how many more cows would we need so

shall take a glimpse of some of them. We will not be looking at different systems in a chronological order, but rather an order that shows us the main stages in the development of the idea of number representation.

But first, let us explore some of the foundational ideas needed to count and to determine the number of objects in a given collection.


## The Mechanism of Counting

Imagine that we are living in the Stone Age, say, around ten thousand years ago. Suppose we have a herd of cows. Here are some natural questions that we might ask about our herd—


## grazing?

that we have the same number of cows as our neighbour?

We need to tackle these questions without the use of the number names or written numbers of the Hindu number system. How do we do it?

Here are some possible methods.

Method 1: We could tackle the questions by using pebbles, sticks or any object that is available in abundance. Let us choose sticks. For every cow in the herd, we could keep a stick. The final collection of sticks tells us the number of cows, which can be used to check if any cows have gone missing.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

This way of associating each cow with a stick, such that no two cows are associated or mapped to the same stick is called a one-to-one mapping. This mapping can then be used to come up with a way to represent numbers, as shown in the table.

Number | Its representation (using sticks)

un PF won eB

(?) How will you use such sticks to answer the other two questions (Q2 and Q3)?

Method 2: Instead of objects, we could use a standard sequence of sounds or names. For example, we could use the sounds of the letters of any language. While counting, we could make a one-to-one mapping between the objects and the letters: that is, associate each object to be counted with a letter, following the letter-order. This mapping can then be used to come up with a way of verbally representing numbers.

For example, we get the following number representation if we use English letters ‘a’ to ‘z’.

Number Its representation (using sounds or names)

An obvious limitation of using only the letters of the English alphabet in this form is that it cannot be used to count collections having more than 26 objects.

ea,

ag How many numbers can you represent in this way using the sounds (‘a of the letters of your language? Talk

Method 3: We could use a sequence of written symbols as follows.

Table 1 Representation | I Il | W| Wy} V | VI | VIL] VI | x | xX using symbols

Representation | XI | XII | XIII | XIV} XV | XVI | XVII} XVIII | XIX | Xx using symbols

@ Do you see a way of extending this method to represent bigger numbers as well? How?

From the discussion above, we see that for counting and finding the size of a collection, we need a standard sequence of objects, or names, or written symbols, that has a fixed order. Let us call this standard sequence a number system. A collection of objects can be counted by making a one-to-one mapping between them and the standard sequence, following the sequence order.

Since there is no end to numbers, the challenge is to come up with an unending standard sequence/number system that is easy to count with. Using sticks gives an unending standard sequence/number system. However, it is not convenient to count larger collections, as we will need as many sticks as the number of objects being counted. Using the sounds of the letters of a language, as in Method 2, is convenient for the counting process but is not an unending standard sequence/number system. The standard sequence/number system given in Method 3 was actually the system used in Europe before it got replaced by the Hindu number system. It is called the Roman number system. It was widely used in Europe for centuries, and was convenient for many purposes, but had the similar drawback that one cannot write arbitrarily large numbers without introducing more and more symbols. We will learn more about this system of writing numbers later on.


## A Story of Numbers weet

As illustrated by the three methods, history gives us examples of number systems formed using physical objects (such as sticks, pebbles, body parts, etc.), names, and written symbols. Some groups of people had numbers represented both by physical objects as well as by names, while others like the Chinese had all three forms of representation. The symbols occurring in a written number system are called numerals. For example, 0, 1, 5, 36, 193, etc., are some of the numerals occurring in the Hindu number system. Numerals representing ‘smaller’ numbers always had names, and so a number system composed of written symbols always went hand in hand with a number system composed of names, as is the case with the modern-day Hindu system.

Without using either the = : Math number names or the numerals of the Hindu number system, Talk give a method for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing 7 two numbers or two collections of sticks. 1

One of the oldest methods of number representation is by making notches—marks cut on a surface such as a bone or a wall of a cave. These marks are also called tally marks.

In this method, a mark is made for each object that is being counted. So the final collection of marks represents the total number of objects. This method is very similar to the method of using sticks to count (Method 1), except for the fact that a mark is made instead of adding a stick.

Archaeologists have discovered bones dating back more than 20,000 years that seem to have tally marks. The oldest known such bones with markings that are thought to represent numbers are the Ishango bone and the Lebombo bone. The Ishango bone, dating back 20,000 to 35,000 years, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It features notches arranged in columns, possibly indicating calendrical systems. The Lebombo bone, discovered in South Africa, is an even older tally stick with 29 notches, estimated to be around 44,000 years old. It is considered one of the oldest mathematical artefacts, and may have served as a tally stick or lunar calendar.

## III. Number Names Obtained by Counting in Twos

A group of indigenous people in Australia called the Gumulgal had the following words for their numbers.


## Gumulgal (Australia)

## RaASWNe

@ Can you see how their number names are formed?

The number name for 3 is composed of number names of 2 and 1. The number name for 4 is composed of two occurrences of the number name for 2.

eg Can you see how the names of the other numbers are formed?

The numbers are counted in 2s, using which the number names are formed: 3=2+1,4=2+2,5=2+2+1,6=2+2+2. Gumulgal called any number greater than 6 ras.

There is a very interesting and puzzling historical phenomenon associated with this number system. Look at the following number systems of a group of indigenous people in South America, and the Bushmen of South Africa:

## A Story of Numbers weet

Despite being so far apart geographically, and with no trace of contact between them, these three groups have developed equivalent number systems! Historians have wondered how this happened. One theory is that these three groups of people may have had common ancestors, who used this number system. In course of time, their descendants migrated to these places.

Even though the number system of Gumulgal had number names for numbers only till 6, we can see the emergence of an idea here. Counting in 2s is more efficient for representing numbers than, for example, a tally system. A general form which this idea has taken in different number systems is as follows: count in groups of a certain number (like 2 in the case of Gumulgal’s system), and use the word or symbol associated with this group size to represent bigger numbers. Some of the commonly used group sizes in different number systems have been 2, 5, 10 and 20. You can find the idea of counting by 5s in the Roman system (Table 1).

This idea of counting in a certain group size and using it to represent numbers is an important idea in the history of the evolution of number systems.

One of the phenomena that could have led people to this idea might be the human limit for immediately knowing the size of a collection at a glance. Let us try out the following activity.

@ Quickly count the number of objects in each of the following boxes:

Up to what group size could you immediately see the number of objects without counting? Most humans find it difficult to count groups having 5 or more objects in a single glance.

a What could be the difficulties with using a number system that counts

only in groups of a single particular size? How would you represent a number like 1345 in a system that counts only by 5s?

Even though counting in groups of a particular size and using it for number representation is more efficient than the tally system, this method can still become cumbersome for larger numbers. The next system shows a refinement of this idea.


## IV. The Roman Numerals

We have already seen the Roman number system till 20 (Table 1). We have seen that it uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10.

To get the Roman numeral for any number till 39, it is first grouped into as many 10s as possible, the remaining is grouped into as many 5s as possible, and finally the remaining is grouped into 1s.

Example: Let us take the number 27.

27=10+10+5+1+1

So, 27 in Roman numerals is XXVII.

Instead of representing 50 as XXXXX, a new symbol is given to it: L. Following the way the number 4 is represented as 1 less than 5 — that is, as IV — 40 is represented as 10 less than 50 — that is, as XL. However, people using this system were not always consistent with this practice. Sometimes, 40 was also represented as XXXX.

The Roman number system introduces newer symbols to represent certain bigger numbers. Let us call all these numbers that have a new basic symbol as landmark numbers. Here are some of the landmark numbers of the Roman system and their associated numerals.

500


## A Story of Numbers a

These symbols are used to denote other numbers as well. For example, consider the number 2367. Writing it as a sum of landmark numbers starting from 1000 such that we take as many 1000s as possible, 500s as possible, and so on, we get

2367 = 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 +50+10+5+1+1 So in Roman numerals, this number is MMCCCLXII.


## @ Figure it Out

1. Represent the following numbers in the Roman system.

(i) 1222 (ii) 2999 (iii) 302 (iv) 715

We see how vastly efficient this system is compared to some of the previous number systems that we have seen. This system seems to have evolved out of the ancient Greek number system in around the 8th century BCE in Rome, and evolved over time. It spread throughout Europe with the expansion of the Roman empire.

The efficiency of this system is due to the grouping of a given number by not just one group size, but a sequence of group sizes that we call landmark numbers, and then using these landmark numbers to represent the given number. This idea is the next important breakthrough in the history of the evolution of number systems.

Despite the relative efficiency of the Roman system, it doesn’t lend itself to an easy performance of arithmetic operations, particularly multiplication and division.

@ Example: Try adding the following numbers without converting them


## to Hindu numerals:

(a) CCXXXII + CCCCXII Let us find the total number of Is, Xs, and Cs, and group them starting from the largest landmark number. Apparently, it looks like the largest landmark number is C, but note that 5 Cs (100s) make a D (500). So the sum is

without converting them to Hindu numerals? Try to find the product CF of the following pairs of landmark numbers: V x L, L x D, V x D, yy, VII x IX.


## Multiply CCXXXI and MDCCCLII

People using the Roman system made use of a calculating tool called the abacus to perform their arithmetic operations. We will see what it is ina later section. However, only specially trained people used this tool for calculation.

While going through the number systems discussed above, it should not be understood that, historically, one system developed as an improvement over the previous system. This point should be kept in mind when studying the upcoming number systems too. The actual story of how each of the number systems developed is much more complex, and many times not clearly known, and so we will not try to trace this in the chapter.

## 3.3 The Idea of a Base


## I. The Egyptian Number System


## WY

We are now going to see a written number system that the Egyptians developed around 3000 BCE. In this system, we see the use of landmark numbers to group and represent a given number. However, what makes this system special is its sequence of landmark numbers.

Imagine making collections of pebbles. The first landmark number is 1. Group together 10 collections of the previous landmark number (1). Its size is the second landmark number which is 10. Group together 10 collections of the previous landmark number (10). Its size is the third landmark number which is 10 x 10 = 100, and so on.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 ©

Each landmark number is 10 times the previous one. Since 1 is the first landmark number, they are all powers of 10. The following are the symbols given to these numbers —

N27 et See ee a CS 0 \ As in the case of Roman numbers, a given number is counted in groups of the landmark numbers, starting from the largest landmark number less than the given number. This is then used to assign the numeral.

## II. Variations on the Egyptian System and the Notion of Base

@ Instead of grouping together 10 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number (as in the case of the Egyptian system), can we get a number system by grouping together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number? Can this 5 be replaced by any positive integer?

Let us examine this possibility. Let 1 be the first landmark number. Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number (1). Its size is the second landmark number which is 5. Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number (5). Its size is the third landmark number which is 5 x 5 = 25. Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number (5). Its size is the fourth landmark number which is 5 25 = 125.

Thus, we have a new number system where each landmark number is 5 times the previous one. Since 1 is the first landmark number, they are all powers of 5.

5°=1 5'=5 =25 =125 5*= 625 5°= 3125


## Aoo0o0- 1


## @ Express the number 143 in this new system.

Let us start grouping, starting with the size 5*= 125, as this is the largest landmark number smaller than 143. We get—

143 =125+54+5+5+1+1+1. So the number 143 in the new system is ()[_]| AAA: Number systems having landmark numbers in which the (a) first landmark number is 1, and

(b) every next landmark number is obtained by multiplying the current landmark number by some fixed number n is said to be a base-n number system.

Contrast the addition done in a base-n number system with that done in the Roman system. In the Roman system, the grouping and rearranging has to be done carefully as it is not always by the same size that each landmark number has to be grouped to get the next one.

The advantage of a number system with a base becomes more evident when we consider multiplication.

eg What would be a simple rule to multiply a number with ?

As has been seen, a process of multiplying two numbers involves the multiplication of landmark numbers. When the landmark numbers are powers of a number, then their product is another landmark number. This fact simplifies the process of multiplication. However, this is not the case with the Roman numerals, which is why multiplication using them is difficult.

Thus, a number system whose landmark numbers are powers of a number, i.e., a number system with a hase, is efficient not only in number representation but also in its utility in carrying out arithmetic operations.

The idea of a number system with a base was a turning point in the history of the evolution of number systems. Our modern Hindu number system is built on this structure.


## Abacus that Makes Use of the Decimal System

In around the 11th century, even the people still using the Roman numerals started using a calculating device—the abacus—constructed using a decimal system. It was a board with lines, as shown in the Fig. 3.1. Starting from the line that stood for 1, each successive line stood for a successive power of 10.


## Fig. 3.1: Abacus

Numbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was first grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the same way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as many counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred

in the grouping. The presence of a counter above a line contributed a value of 5.

For example let us take the number 3426. It can be grouped as

3426 = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 10+ 10+ 1+1+

1+1+1+1

This number was represented as shown in Fig. 3.1. Notice how the 6 ones are represented.

To get an idea of how the abacus was used for calculations, let us consider a simple addition problem: 2907 + 43. The two numbers were taken on either side of the vertical partition.

How would you use this to find the sum?

The counters along each line were brought together. What is to be done if the total in a line exceeded 10?

Hint: In this problem, the 7 ones and the 3 ones together make 10 ones which contributes a counter to the line representing 10s.


## III. Shortcomings of the Egyptian System

Despite being a number system that enabled relatively efficient number representations for numbers till a crore (10’), and relatively easy computations, the Egyptian system had a drawback.

If larger and larger numbers needed to be represented, then there was a need for inventing an unending sequence of symbols for higher and higher powers of 10. Here we see the original challenge of number representation resurfacing in a different form!

The next and the final idea in the history of the evolution of number systems not only solves this problem but also remarkably simplifies number representation and computations!

## 3.4. Place Value Representation


## I. The Mesopotamian Number System

In the beginning, the number system used in ancient Mesopotamia had different symbols for different landmark numbers. In later times, it became a base-60 system, also called the sexagesimal system, with a very efficient number representation.

It has puzzled many why they chose base 60. Different theories exist to explain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of some important events (like the length of their lunar month which had 30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth when Earth is taken to be stationary), the ease of representing fractions (we will not go into this here), their earlier sequence of landmark numbers — 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, 36000,... — getting reduced to only the powers of 60, and so on.

The influence of the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system, also known as the Babylonian number system, can be seen even now in our units of time measurements— 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds.

This system used the symbol ¥ for 1 and < for 10.

Let us now briefly pause on the study of their number system, and ideate on how one can build an efficient number system using the Mesopotamian features seen so far.

A Story of Numbers » < Let us give our own symbols to their landmark numbers —

(2 Example: Let us try another number — 7530. 7530 = (2) x3600 + (5) x 60 + 30

So, its representation would be


## TOOK

Note that when a number is grouped into powers of 60 for its representation, no power of 60 can occur 60 or more times. If this happens, then 60 of them can be grouped to form the next power of 60. For example, consider the expression —

(1) x 3600 + (70) x 60 +2 = (1) x 607 + (60+ 10) x 60+2 = (1) x 60? + 60°+ (10) x 60+ 2 = (2) x 60? + (10) x 60 + 2 Therefore, any number can be represented using the numerals from 1-59, along with the numerals for landmark numbers. Now, what if we make the representation even more compact by dropping the symbols for the different powers of 60 altogether?


## a


## A Story of Numbers ”

This is exactly what the Mesopotamians did! In their numeral, the rightmost set of symbols showed the number of 1s, the set of symbols to its left showed the number of 60s, the next showed the number of 3600s and so on. Whenever there was no occurrence of a power of 60, a blank space was given in that position.

It does not seem that the Mesopotamians arrived at this idea in the same way we did. Some scholars suggest that the similarity of symbols given to the landmark numbers 1 and 60 in their earlier number system, and an accidental usage of them, might have made them stumble upon this idea.

@ Figure it Out 1. Represent the following numbers in the Mesopotamian system —

(@) 63 (ii) 132 (iii) 200 (iv) 60 (v) 3605

Thus, we can see how the Mesopotamian system removes the need for generating an unending sequence of symbols for the landmark numbers by making use of the positions where the symbols are written. Such a number system (having a base) that makes use of the position of each symbol in determining the landmark number that it is associated with is called a positional number system or a place value system.

This idea of place value marks the highest point in the history of evolution of number systems, and gives a very elegant solution to the problem of representing the unending sequence of numbers using only a finite number of different symbols!

The Mesopotamian system however cannot be considered a fully developed place value system. It has certain defects that lead to confusion while reading a number.

@ Look at the representation of 60. What will be the representation for 3,600? While writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not given the way we are giving it here. It was also difficult to maintain a consistent spacing for blanks across different manuscripts written by different people. These created ambiguities. For example, consider the representations of the following numbers —


## Numbers


## Our representation


## Mesopotamian representation


## wat


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 ©

Because of the ambiguity in finding which symbols correspond to which powers of 60, the same numeral can be read in different ways. Even in our representation which uses uniform spacing between symbols for different powers of 60, it is difficult to know the number of blanks between two sets of symbols, as in the representation of 36002.

To address the issue arising out of blank spaces, the later Mesopotamians used a brilliant idea of assigning a ‘placeholder’ symbol to denote a blank space. This is like the 0 (zero) we use in our system. Thus, zero—the symbol that shows nothingness—is indispensable as a placeholder in a place value system in which numbers are written in an unambiguous manner.

Even with the problem arising out of blank spaces solved, other ambiguities still remained in the system. For example, the placeholder symbol was primarily used in the middle of numbers and not at the end; so they would not use it to represent a number like (what we would write as) 3600.

In Central America, there flourished a civilisation known as the Mayan civilisation that made great intellectual and cultural progress between the 3rd and 10th centuries CE.

Here we find a puzzling phenomenon. Why was their third landmark

number 360 rather than 400? Some scholars feel that this might have something to do with their calendars.

They used a dot @ for 1, and a bar —— for 5. These were used to denote numbers from 1 to 19.

The symbols associated with different landmark numbers were written one below the other with the lowermost set of symbols corresponding to the number of 1s, the set above corresponding to the number of 20s, the set above to the number of 360s and so on.

@ Represent the following numbers using the Mayan system:

(i) 77 (ii) 100 (iii) 361 (iv) 721

Because the Mayan system is not an actual base-20 system, it lacks the advantages that a system with a base has for computations. Nevertheless, their place value notation and their use of a placeholder symbol for zero is considered an important advance in the history of number systems.

A curious fact is that we can still find the use of base-20 in the number names of some European languages.


## III. The Chinese Number System

The Chinese used two number systems—a written system for recording quantities, and asystem making use ofrods for performing computations. The numerals in the rod-based number system are called rod numerals. Here we discuss the rod numerals, which are more efficient in writing and computing with numbers than the written system of the Chinese. The rod numerals developed in China by at least by 3rd century AD

and were used till the 17th century. It was a decimal system (base-10). The symbols for 1 to 9 were as follows:

Note: The zongs represent units, hundreds, tens of thousands, etc., and the hengs tens, thousands, hundreds of thousands, etc.

reading or writing numerals. It is for this reason that the Hindu number system is now used throughout the world.

The use of 0 as a digit, and indeed as a number, was a breakthrough that truly changed the world of mathematics and science. In Indian mathematics, indeed, zero was not just used as a placeholder in the place value system, but was also given the status of a number in its own right, on par with other numbers. The arithmetic properties of the number 0 (e.g., that 0 plus any number is the same number, and that 0 times any number is zero) were explicitly used by Aryabhata in his Aryabhatiya in 499 CE to compute with and do elaborate scientific computations using Hindu numerals. The use of 0 as a number like any other number, on which one can perform the basic arithmetic operations, was codified by Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta in 628 CE, as we learned in an earlier grade.

By introducing 0 as a number, along with the negative numbers, Brahmagupta created what in modern terms is called a ring, ie., a set of numbers that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication (i.e., any two numbers in the set can be added, subtracted, or multiplied to get another number in that set). These new ideas laid the foundations for modern mathematics, and particularly for the areas of algebra and analysis.

Hopefully, this gives you a sense of all the ideas that went into writing and computing with numbers in the way that we do today. The discovery of 0 and the resulting Indian number system is truly one of the greatest, most creative, and most influential inventions of all time—appearing constantly in our daily lives and forming the basis of much of modern science, technology, computing, accounting, surveying, and more. The next time you are writing numbers, think about the incredible history behind them and all the deep ideas that went into their discovery!

In this chapter, we will study some interesting types of four-sided figures and solve problems based on them. Such figures are commonly known as quadrilaterals. The word ‘quadrilateral’ is derived from Latin words — quadri meaning four, and latus referring to sides.

## Quadrilaterals


## 4.1 Rectangles and Squares

We know what rectangles are. Let us define them.

Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which— (@) The angles are all right angles (90°), and (ii) The opposite sides are of equal length.

The definition precisely states the conditions a quadrilateral has to satisfy to be called a rectangle.

@ Are there other ways to define a rectangle?

Let us consider the following problem related to the construction of rectangles.


## A Carpenter’s Problem

@ A carpenter needs to put together ® c

two thin strips of wood, as shown in Fig. 1, so that when a thread is passed through their endpoints, it forms a rectangle.

She already has one 8 cm long strip. What should be the length of the other strip? Where should they both be joined?

Let us first model the structure Fig. 1 that the carpenter has to make. The strips can be modelled as line segments. They are the diagonals of the quadrilateral formed by their endpoints. For the quadrilateral to be a rectangle, we need to answer the following questions —

?) 1. What is the length of the other diagonal? ?) 2. What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals? ?) 3. What should the angle be between the diagonals?

?) Let us answer these questions using geometric reasoning (deduction). If that is challenging, try to construct/ measure some rectangles.

To find the answers to these AC=8cm questions, let us suppose that we have placed the diagonals such that their endpoints form the vertices of a rectangle, as shown in Fig. 2. A D


## Fig. 2 o

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Deduction 1— What is the length of the other diagonal?

This can be deduced using congruence as follows— B c

Since ABCD is a rectangle, we have AB = CD

ZBAD = ZCDA = 90°

AD is common to both triangles.


## So, AADC = ADAB by the SAS congruence condition. A


## Common side

Therefore, AC = BD, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always have the same length.

So the other diagonal must also be 8 cm long. You can verify this property by constructing/measuring some rectangles.

Deduction 2— Whatis the point of intersection of the two diagonals?

This can also be found using congruence. Since we need to know the relation between OA and OC, and OB and OD, which two triangles of the rectangle ABCD should we consider?


## B iG B c he SG A D A D

The blue angles are equal since In order to show congruence, they are vertically opposite consider 41 and 22. Are they angles. equal? B c B c 0 A D A D Since ZB = 90°, In ABCD, since 23+ Z1=90°. Z3 + 22+ 90 = 180,

a g have 23 +22 = 90°. ,


## Quadrilaterals

So, 21 = 22 (= 90° - 23). Thus, by the AAS condition for congruence, AAOB = ACOD.

Hence OA = OC and OB = OD, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. So, O is the midpoint of AC and BD.

This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always intersect at their midpoints.

Therefore, to get a rectangle, the diagonals must be drawn so that they are equal and intersect at their midpoints.

When the diagonals cross at their midpoints, we say that the diagonals bisect each other. Bisecting a quantity means dividing it into two equal parts.

Verify this property by constructing some rectangles and measuring their diagonals and the points of intersection. ©

?) Can the following equalities be used to establish that AAOD = ACOB? Ca AO = CO (proved above) Spi


## ZAOB = ZCOD (vertically opposite angles) AD = CB

Deduction 3— What are the angles between the diagonals? Let us check what quadrilateral we getifwe draw the A B two diagonals such that their lengths are equal, they

bisect each other and have an arbitrary angle, say 60°, between them as shown in the figure to the right.

?) Can you find all the remaining angles? —)


## D c

QY We can find the remaining angles between the 120° (X)120° diagonals using our understanding of vertically . opposite angles and linear pairs.


## A

In AAOB, since OA = OB, the angles opposite them are equal, say a.

?) Can you find the value of a?


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

In AAOB, we have, a+a+60 = 180 (interior angles of a triangle). Therefore 2a = 120.


## Thus a = 60.

Similarly, we can find the values of all the other angles. A B D c

?) Can we now identify what type of quadrilateral ABCD is?

Notice that its angles all add up to 90° (30° + 60°).

(?) What can we say about its sides? A B A


## D Cc D Cc

We can see that AAOB ~ ACOD and AAOD ~ ACOB. Hence, AB = CD, and AD = CB, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle since it satisfies the definition of a


## rectangle.

?) Will ABCD remain a rectangle if the angles between the diagonals are changed? Can we generalise this?

Take one of the angles between the diagonals as x.


## A


## Quadrilaterals

We can compute the four angles between the diagonals to be x, x, 180 - x, and 180 - x.

180° - x yer =x ?) Can you find the other angles?

c Since we know that AAOB is isosceles, we can denote the measures of both ofits base angles by a. ?) What is the value of a (in degrees) in terms of x? We have, ata+x=180 (sum of the interior angles of a triangle) 2a =180-x _ (80-x) a=

= 90-3. D Similarly, in the isosceles AAOD, let the base angles be b. b+b+180-x=180

2b = 180 - (180 - x) 2b = 180-180+x 2b =x

All the angles of the quadrilateral are a + b, which is

90-5 +5 = 90. Thus, all four angles of the quadrilateral ABCD are 90°.

(?) What can we say about AB and CD, and AD and BC? D

We have AAOB = ACOD and AAOD = ACOB. Hence, AB = CD, and AD = CB, since they are the corresponding parts of congruent triangles.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Hence, no matter what the angles between the diagonals are, if the diagonals are equal and they bisect each other, then the angles of the quadrilateral formed are 90° each, and the opposite sides are equal. Thus, the quadrilateral is a rectangle.

Now we know how the wooden strips have to be put together to form the vertices of a rectangle! They should be equal and connected at their midpoints.

This method is actually used in practice to make rectangles. Carpenters in Europe use this method to get a rectangular frame. It is also known that farmers in Mozambique, a country in Africa, use this method while constructing houses to get the base of the house in a rectangular shape.


## The Process of Finding Properties

As we have been seeing from lower grades,

properties of geometric objects such as parallel lines, angles, and triangles can be deduced through geometric reasoning. We will continue to deduce properties of special types of quadrilaterals in this chapter.

Once you have deduced a property ofa quadrilateral, it is good to verify it with a real-world quadrilateral, either the quadrilateral constructed on paper or simply a surface having the shape of the quadrilateral.

If you are not able to figure out the property using deduction, you could experiment by taking real-world quadrilaterals and observing the property through measurement. Note that these observations give useful insights about the property, but with them, we can only form a conjecture, that is, a statement about which we are highly confident, but not yet sure if it always holds true. For example, constructing a few rectangles and observing through measurement that their diagonals bisect each other does not necessarily mean that this will always be the case—can we be sure that the 1000th rectangle we construct will also have this property? The only way we can be sure of this property is by justifying or proving the statement, just as we did in Deduction 2.

| Note to the Teacher: Gently encourage students to deduce or justify properties. ' ' Whenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and ! , observe, and use their intuition to figure out the properties. '


## Quadrilaterals

The Carpenter’s Problem shows that rectangles can also be defined as follows—

Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are equal and bisect each other.

Observe how different this definition is from the earlier one. Yet, both capture the same class of quadrilaterals. Further, it turns out that the first definition can be simplified.

@ In the earlier definition, we stated that a rectangle has (a) opposite sides

of equal length, and (b) all angles equal to 90°. Would we be wrong if we just define a rectangle as a quadrilateral in which all the angles are 90°?

@ If you think that this definition is incomplete, try constructing a

quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90° but the opposite sides are not equal.

Are you able to construct such a quadrilateral? Let us prove why this is impossible.

Deduction 4— What is the shape of a quadrilateral with all the angles equal to 90°?

?) Consider a quadrilateral ABCD with all angles measuring 90°. What can

we say about the opposite sides of such a quadrilateral? Join BD. ABAD and ADCB seem congruent. Can we justify this claim? B c

Two equalities can be directly seen in the triangles. What can we say about 41 and 22?


## A D

Recall that we tackled a very similar problem in Deduction 2. We can use the same reasoning here. B c B Cc

Since ZB = 90°, In ABCD, since Z3+ Z1=90°. Z3 + Z2 + 90° = 180°, Z3+ Z2=90°.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

So, 21 = 22. Thus, by the AAS congruence condition, ABAD ~ ADCB.

Therefore, AD = CB, and DC = BA, since these are corresponding sides of congruent triangles.

(2) Is it wrong to write ABAD = ACDB? Why?

Thus, we have established that if all the angles of a quadrilateral are right angles, then the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as follows —

Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90°. Let us list the properties of a rectangle. Property 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90°.

Property 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.

@ Are the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel?

They definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the transversal properties.

Notice that ABactsasatransversaltoAD 8 c and BC, and that 7A + 7B = 90° + 90° = 180°. (J L

When the sum of the internal angles on the same side of the transversal is 180°, the lines are parallel. We can use this fact to conclude that the lines AD and BC are parallel, which we represent as AD | | BC.

Can you similarly show that AB is parallel to DC (AB| | DC)?

Property 3: The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel to each other.

Property 4: The diagonals of a rectangle are of equal length and they bisect each other.

## Quadrilaterals

All these quadrilaterals are rectangles, including (iv). Quadrilateral (iv) is a rectangle because all its angles are 90°. However, it is a special kind of rectangle with all sides of equal length. We know that this quadrilateral is also called a square.

Square: A square is a quadrilateral in which all the angles are equal to 90°, and all the sides are of equal length.

Thus, every square is also a rectangle, but clearly every rectangle is not a square.

Malayali. How can you be both?

This relation can be pictorially represented using a Venn diagram. We have seen these diagrams before. In a Venn diagram, a set of objects is represented as points inside a closed curve. Typically, these closed curves are ovals or circles.

For example, the set of all squares is represented as

Each point in the region represents a square, thereby covering all the possible squares.

Since every square is a rectangle, the Venn diagram representation of these two sets would be as follows —


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Let us consider the Carpenter’s Problem again. If the wooden strips have to be placed such that the thread passing through their endpoints forms a square, what must be done?

As in the previous case, let us try to construct a square, one of whose diagonals is of length 8 cm.

While solving the Carpenter’s Problem for the case of a rectangle, we have seen that to get a quadrilateral with all angles 90° (and opposite sides of equal length), the diagonals have to be drawn such that —

(i) they are of equal lengths, and A D (ii) they bisect each other.

?) What more needs to be done to get equal sidelengths as well? Can this be achieved by properly choosing the angle between the diagonals? See if you can reason and/or experiment to figure this out!


## B Cc

Deduction 5— What should be the angle formed by the diagonals?

The angle between the diagonals canbe found using the notion ofcongruence! Suppose we join the equal diagonals such that they bisect each other and result in a square. Let us label the square ABCD.

To find the angle formed by the diagonals, what are the two triangles we should consider for congruence?


## A


## B


## By the SSS condition for congruence, ABOA = ABOC

D c Can this be used to find the angles “BOA and BOC formed by the diagonals?

Since these angles are corresponding parts of congruent triangles, they are equal. Further, these angles together form a straight angle. So ZBOA + ZBOC = 180°. Thus, these angles have to be 90° each.


## Quadrilaterals

This shows that the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles. This means that the diagonals have to be drawn such that they are of equal lengths and bisect each other at right angles. Since the endpoints of the diagonals uniquely determine the vertices of a quadrilateral, we will get a square when the diagonals are joined this way.

@ Using this fact, construct a square with a diagonal of length 8 cm.


## Properties of a Square

Since a square is a special type of rectangle, all the properties of a rectangle hold true for a square.

@ Verify if this is true by going through geometric reasoning in Deduction 1 and Deduction 2, and see if they apply to a square as well.

Property 1: All the sides of a square are equal to each other. Property 2: The opposite sides of a square are parallel to each other. Property 3: The angles of a square are all 90°.

Property 4: The diagonals of a square are of equal length and they bisect each other at 90°. There is one more special property of a square.

@ What are the measures of 71, 72, 23, and 24? See if you can reason and/or experiment to figure this out!

In AADC, we have,

Z1+ 23+ 90 =180

Since AD = DC, we have 41 = 23. Thus, 21 = 23 = 45°.


## D

Similarly, find 22 and 24. Thus, we have another property of a square —

Property 5: The diagonals ofa square divide the angles of the square into equal halves. This can also be expressed as—The diagonals of a square bisect the angles of the square.

a Is it possible to construct a quadrilateral with three angles equal to 90° and the fourth angle not equal to 90°?

You might have observed through constructions that this may not be possible.

@ But why not? This is due to a general property of quadrilaterals related to their angles. We have seen that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°. There is a similar regularity in the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral.


## eer ae


## Quadrilaterals

Consider a quadrilateral SOME. al Draw a diagonal SM. We get two S triangles ASEM and ASOM. S2 In ASEM, we have 41 + 22 + 23 = 180°. And in ASOM, 24+ 25 + 26 = 180°. What do we get when we add all six angles? We will have A \ 1+ 22+ 23+ 24+ 25+ Z6 = 180° + 180° ly (N = 360°. Or, (21+ 24) + (23 + 26) +22 + 25 = 360°. » Since (21+ 24), (23+ 26), 72 and 45 are the angles of this quadrilateral, we have the following result —

The sum of all angles in any quadrilateral is 360°.

This explains why it is impossible for a quadrilateral to have three right angles, with the fourth angle not right angle.


## 4.3 More Quadrilaterals with Parallel Opposite Sides

Rectangles (and therefore squares) have parallel opposite sides.

Are there quadrilaterals that have parallel opposite sides that are not rectangles?

Let us try constructing one. This can be easily done by drawing two pairs of parallel lines, ensuring that they do not meet at right angles.

Construct such a figure by recalling how parallel lines can be constructed using a ruler and a set-square, or a compass and a ruler.

Observe the quadrilateral ABCD. It has parallel opposite sides but is not a rectangle.

Thus, a larger set of quadrilaterals exists in which the opposite sides are parallel. Such quadrilaterals are called parallelograms.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

@ Is a rectangle a parallelogram?

A rectangle has opposite sides parallel. So, it satisfies the parallelogram’s definition. Hence, it is indeed a parallelogram. More specifically, a rectangle is a special kind of parallelogram with all its angles equal to 90°.

Let us represent this relation using a Venn diagram.

To understand the relations between the sides and the angles of a parallelogram, let us construct the following figure.

D c @ Draw a parallelogram with adjacent 5cm


## sides of lengths 4 cm and 5 cm, and


## an angle of 30° between them.


## A 4cm B D : 5cm


## Step 1: Draw line segments AB = 4


## cm and AD = 5 cm with an angle of 5


## 30° between them. 30 F

A 4cm Step 2: Draw a line parallel to AB D c through the point D, and a line parallel to AD through B. Mark the Scm point at which these lines intersect as C. 30° A 4cm B

ABCD is the required parallelogram.

@ What are the remaining angles of the parallelogram? What are the lengths of the remaining sides? See if you can reason out and/or

(96) experiment to figure these out. 96


## Quadrilaterals

@ Deduction 6— What can we say about the angles of a parallelogram? In the parallelogram ABCD, AB| |CD, and AD is a transversal to them.

ZA + ZD = 180° (sum of the p


## internal angles on the same side of

a transversal). Scm Therefore,

ZD = 180 — ZA = 180 — 30 = 150°. a Similarly, AD||BC, and AB and

CD are transversals to them. A 4cm

So, ZA + ZB = 180°.

So, ZC + ZD = 180°. Using these equations, we get 7B = 150° and ZC = 30°. We see that in this parallelogram, the adjacent pairs of angles add

up to 180° and opposite pairs of angles are equal. Thus,

ZA + ZB = 180°, ZA + ZD = 180°, ZC + ZD = 180°, and 2B + ZC = 180°. And, A= ZC, and ZB = ZD.

Since the adjacent angles are the interior angles on the same side of a transversal to a pair of parallel lines, they must add up to 180°.

?) What about the opposite angles? Will they be equal in all parallelograms? If yes, how can we be sure? R

Let us take one of the angles to be x. What are the other angles? Since ZP + ZR = 180°, ZR= 180 - ZP = 180 -x. Similarly, since 7A + ZR = 180°, ZA = 180- ZR = 180 - (180-x) = 180 -180+x=x. Thus, ZP = ZA =x. P E Similarly, we can deduce that 7 R= ZE = 180-x. Therefore, this shows that the opposite angles of a parallelogram are always equal.

a Deduction 7— What can we say about the sides of a parallelogram?

By looking at a parallelogram, it appears that the opposite sides are equal.

Can we again use congruence to show this? Which two triangles can be considered for this?


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

In AABD and ACDB, the angles marked with a single arc are equal as they are the opposite angles of a parallelogram.

Since AD | | BC,andBDisatransversal to it, the angles marked with double arcs are equal as they are alternate angles.

So, by the AAS condition, the triangles are congruent, that is, AABD ~ ACDB.


## A B

Therefore, AD = CB, and AB = CD. Thus, the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.

(2) Is it wrong to write AABD = ACBD? Why?

From these deductions we can find the remaining sides and angles of the parallelogram.

Let us list the properties of a parallelogram. Property 1: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. Property 2: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel.

Property 3: In a parallelogram, the adjacent angles add up to 180°, and the opposite angles are equal.

@ Are the diagonals of a parallelogram always equal? Check with the

parallelogram that you have constructed. We see that the diagonals of a parallelogram need not be equal.

Do they bisect each other (do they intersect at their midpoints)? Reason and/or experiment to figure this out.

Deduction 8— What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals in a parallelogram?

As in the case of a rectangle, we can find out if the diagonals bisect each other by examining the congruence of AAOE and AYOS in the parallelogram EASY.

AE = YS (as they are the opposite sides of the parallelogram)

The angles marked using a single arc are equal, and so are the angles marked using a double arc, since they are alternate angles of parallel lines.

Thus, by the ASA condition, the triangles 5 are congruent, that is,

AAOE = AYOS.

Therefore, OA = OY, and OE = OS, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles.

Thus, O is the midpoint of both diagonals.

(2) Is it wrong to write AAOE = ASOY? Why?


## Property 4: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

@ Do the diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at a particular angle?


## 4.4 Quadrilaterals with Equal Sidelengths

a Are squares the only quadrilaterals that have

equal sidelengths? Let us explore this question D through construction.

Draw two equal sides AD and AB, that are not perpendicular to each other.

50° A B

Can we complete this quadrilateral so that all its sides are of the same length?

Mark a point C whose distance from B and Dis equal to AB (or AD). To do this, measure AB using a compass. Keeping this length as the radius, cut arcs from B and D.

Z \

Now we have a quadrilateral with , B equal sidelengths and one of its angles 50°. Note that we could have constructed such a quadrilateral by taking any angle less than 180° (in place of 50°).

A quadrilateral in which all the sides have the same length is a rhombus.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

@ What are the other angles of the rhombus ABCD that we have constructed? Reason and/or experiment to figure this out.

Deduction 9— What can we Say about the angles in a rhombus?

Consider a rhombus GAME. In AGAE, since GE = GA, a= d. Similarly, in AMAE, since ME = MA, b=c.

(?) It can be seen that AGAE =~ AMAE

(How?) c (\/

So, a= b,c=dand ZG = ZM (since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles). Thus, we have, a=b=c=d.

These facts hold for any rhombus. Let us apply them to the rhombus ABCD that we constructed earlier. Let the four equal angles formed by the diagonal be a, as shown in the figure

In AADB, we have at+a+50=180°. So, a= 65°.


## A

Thus, the angles of the rhombus ABCD are 50°, 130°, 50°, and 130°.

So, in a rhombus opposite angles are equal to each other.

Interestingly, there is one more way by which we could have figured out the other angles of the rhombus ABCD. We have

shown that in a general rhombus GAME, the four angles formed by a diagonal are equal to each other.


## Ay) G Cy G

Consider the lines EM and GA andits Similarly consider the lines GE transversal AE. Since the alternate and AM and its transversal AE. angles are equal, EM||GA. Since the alternate angles are


## equal, GE| | AM.


## Quadrilaterals

As opposite sides are parallel, GAME is also a parallelogram. Thus, every rhombus is a parallelogram, and the properties of a parallelogram hold true for a rhombus as well.

Now take any 4 numbers, place ‘+’ and ~ signs in the eight different ways, and evaluate the resulting expression. What do you observe about their parities?


## Repeat this with other sets of 4 numbers.

(?) Is there a way to explain why this happens?

Hint: Think of the rules for parity of the sum or difference of two numbers.

Explanation 1: Let us consider any of the 8 expressions formed by four numbers a, b, c, and d. When one of its signs is switched, its value always increases or decreases by an even number! Let us see why. Consider one of the expressions: a+ b—c-d. Replacing +b by — b, we get a-b-c-d. By how much has the number changed? It has changed by (a+ b-c-d)- (a-b-c-d)

=a+b-—c-d-a+b+c+d (notice how the signs changed when we opened the second set of brackets) = 2b (this is an even number).

Ifthe difference between two numbers is even, can they have different parities? No! So either both are even or both are odd. Now, let us see what happens when a negative sign is switched to a positive sign. ?) Replace any negative sign in the expression a + b-c-d with a positive sign and find the difference between the two numbers.

?) What do you conclude from this observation?

Starting from any expression, we can get 7 expressions by switching one or more ‘+’ and ~’ signs. Thus, all the expressions have the same parity! Explanation 2: We know that

odd + odd = even even + even = even odd + even = odd.

We have seen that the parity of a+ b and a- bis the same, regardless of the parities of a and b.

In short, a + b have the same parity. By the same argument, a+ b+c and a+b-c have the same parity. Extending this further, we can say that all the expressions a + b + c +d have the same parity.

The expression 4m + 2q will always evaluate to an even number for any integer values of m and q. We can justify this in two different ways—

We know 4m is even and 2q is even for any integers m and q. Therefore, their sum will also be even.

¢ The expression 4m + 2q is equal to the expression 2(2m + q). Here, the expression 2(2m + q) means 2 times 2m + q. In other words, 2 is a factor of this expression. Therefore, this expression will always give an even number for any integers m and q.

For example, if m = 4 and q = — 9, the expression 4m + 2q becomes 4x 4+2x(-9) =- 2, which is an even number.

In the expression x’ + 2, x’ is even if x is even, and x’ is odd if x is odd. Therefore, the expression x’ + 2 will not always give an even number. An example and a non-example for when the expression evaluates to an even number — (i) ifx = 6, then x’ + 2 = 38, and (ii) if x = 3, then x’ +2 =11.

where 2n is an even number, 2m + 1 is an odd

number, and 6j is a multiple of 6. Then an+2m=6j-1 2(n+m)=6j-1

## 5.2 Checking Divisibility Quickly

Earlier, you have learnt shortcuts to check whether a given number, written in the Indian number system is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10. Let us revisit them.

Divisibility by 10, 5, and 2: If the units digit of a number is ‘0’, then it is divisible by 10. Let us understand why this works through algebra.

We can write the general form of a number in the Indian system using a set of letter-numbers. For example, a 5-digit number can be expressed as, edcba denoting e x 10000 + dx 1000+ cx 100+ bx 10 +a. The letter-numbers e, d, c, b, and a denote each digit of a 5-digit number.

Any number can be written in general as...dcba, where the letter- numbers a, b,c and d represent the units, tens, hundreds and thousands digit, respectively, and so on. As a sum of place values, this number is —

... +1000d + 100c + 10b + a.

(For example, in the number 4075, d= 4, c =0,b=7, anda=5.)

We know that each place value, with the exception of the units place, is a multiple of 10. So, 10b, 100c, ... all will be multiples of 10. Hence, the number will be divisible by 10 if and only if the units digit a is 0.

? Similarly, explain using algebra why the divisibility shortcuts for 5, 2, 4, and 8 work.

Let us now examine shortcuts to check divisibility by some other numbers and explain why they work!


## A Shortcut for Divisibility by 9

? Can you say, without actually calculating, which of these numbers are divisible by 9: 999, 909, 900, 90, 990?


## All of them.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

(?) Can we say that any number made up of only the digits ‘0’ and ‘9’, in any

order, will always be divisible by 9?

Yes, if each digit is either 0 or 9, then each term in its expanded form will be 9 x Ll or 0 x L| (the ‘L!’ denotes a place value). This means each term will be a multiple of 9, for example,

99009 = 9 x 10000 + 9 x 1000 +0 x 100+0x 10+9x1. But this shortcut alone cannot identify all the multiples cs C3370

of 9. Unlike the numbers 2, 5, and 10, we cannot identify

the multiples of 9 by just looking at the unit’s digit. 99 and

109 are two numbers with 9 as the units digit; but 99 is @jq@ ws divisible by 9, while 109 is not. wo

?) Is 10 divisible by 9? If not, what is the remainder?

Check the divisibility of other multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) by 9. You will notice that for any multiple of 10, the remainder is the same as the number of tens.

?) Similarly, look at the remainder when the multiples of 100 (100, 200,

300, ... ) are divided by 9. What do you notice?

The remainder is the same as the number of hundreds for any multiple of 100.

?) Using this observation, find the remainder when 427 is divided by 9.

We see that 427 has 4 hundreds; thus, its corresponding remainder (upon division by 9) would be 4. 427 has 2 tens, and its corresponding remainder would be 2. We have 7 units also remaining. Adding all the remainders, we get 4+ 2 + 7= 13. We can make one more group of 9 with 13, leaving a remainder of 4. Therefore, 427 + 9 gives a remainder of 4.

(?) Will this work with bigger numbers? You can see that this is true for any place value:

eG 1=0+1 Bem 10=9+1 100 =99+1 ae) ws 1000 = 999+1 10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when the corresponding place value is divided by 9.

For example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can just add all the digits—7 + 3 + 0 + 9—to get 19. This can be seen as

Se, oo 0° | a wo Sy qo oS | @= ™ 2 5 oD a 908| => ® goad —!) Ce g mM Ca @

So, we need to just consider this part (Le, 7+3+9=19)

This is a multiple of 9 7x 1000+3x100+0x10+9%x1 =7x (999 +1)+3%x(99+1)+0x(9+1)+9 x (01) =(7x999+3x99+0x9+9x0)+(7x1+3x1+0x1+9x1) =(7x 999 +3 x99+0x9+9x0)+(7+3+0+9).

This is a multiple of 9 So, we need to just consider this part

This means that the number 7309 is 19 more than some multiple of 9. The digits 1 and 9 can further be added to get 1 + 9 = 10. Now, we can say that 7309 is 10 more than a multiple of 9. And repeating this step for the number 10, we get the remainder to be 1 + 0 = 1, meaning 7309 is 1 more than a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7309 = 9 gives a remainder of 1.

Anumber is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Also, we can add the digits of a number repeatedly till a single digit is obtained. This single digit is the remainder when the number is divided by 9.

We know that all the multiples of 9 are also multiples of 3. That is, if a number is divisible by 9, it will also be divisible by 3. However, there are other multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 9 for example— 15, 33, and 87.

2 The shortcut to find the divisibility by 3 is similar to the method for 9. Anumber is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Explore the remainders when powers of 10 are divided by 3. Explain why this method works.

Interestingly, the shortcut for 11 is also based on checking the remainders with place value. Let us see how.

@ How about checking divisibility by 24? Will checking the divisibility by its factors, 4 and 6, work? Why or why not?

Determining divisibility by 24 by checking divisibility by 4 and by 6 does not work. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 4 and 6, but not by 24.

To check for the divisibility by 24, we can instead check for the divisibility by 3 and divisibility by 8.

Explain using prime factorisation why checking divisibility by 3 and 8 works for checking divisibility by 24, but checking divisibility by 4 and 6 is not sufficient for checking divisibility by 24.

There are such shortcuts to check divisibility by every number until 100, and for some numbers beyond 100. You may try to understand how these work after learning certain concepts in higher grades.

For the same reason PQ cannot be 11 as P and Q correspond to different digits. 12 x 8 = 96 fits all the conditions”. Can PQ be 13? Think.

Navakankari, also known as Salu Mane Ata, Char-Par, or Navkakri, is a traditional Indian board game that is the same as ‘Nine Men’s Morris’ or ‘Mills in the West’. It is a strategy game for two players where the goal is to form lines of three pawns to eliminate the opponent’s pawns or block their movement.


## Gameplay

1. Each player starts with 9 pawns. The players take turns in placing their pawns on the marked intersections. An intersection can have at most one pawn.

2. Once all the pawns are placed, the players take turns to move one of their pawns to adjacent empty intersections to form lines of three. The line can be horizontal or vertical.

3. Once a player makes a line with their pawns they can remove any one of the opponent’s pawns as long as it is not a part of one of their lines.

A player wins if the opponent has less than 3 pawns or is unable to make a move.

WE DISTRIBUTE,


## YET THINGS

We have seen how algebra makes use of letter symbols to write general statements about patterns and relations in a compact manner. Algebra can also be used to justify or prove claims and conjectures (like the many properties you saw in the previous chapter) and to solve problems of various kinds.

Distributivity is a property relating multiplication and addition that is captured concisely using algebra. In this chapter, we explore different types of multiplication patterns and show how they can be described in the language of algebra by making use of distributivity.


## 6.1 Some Properties of Multiplication

Increments in Products Consider the multiplication of two numbers, say, 23 x 27.

2? 1. By how much does the product increase if the first number (23) is increased by 1?

(?) 2. What if the second number (27) is increased by 1? (?) 3. How about when both numbers are increased by 1?

2? Do you see a pattern that could help generalise our observations to the product of any two numbers?

Let us first consider a simpler problem—find the increase in the product when 27 is increased by 1. From the definition of multiplication (and the commutative property), it is clear that the product increases by 23. This can be seen from the distributive property of multiplication as well. If a, b and c are three numbers, then —


## Chapter 6 We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply.indd 136 10-07-2025 15:10:48

a(b+c)=ab+ac This property can be visualised nicely using a diagram:


## b columns c columns


## arows

This is called the distributive property of multiplication over addition. Using the identity a (b + c) = ab + ac with a = 23, b = 27, and c=1, we have

(VN 23 (27 + 1) = 23 x 27 +[23]


## Increase

Remember that here, a (b + c) and 23 (27 + 1) mean a x (b + c), and 23 x (27 + 1), respectively. We usually skip writing the ‘x’ symbol before or after brackets, just as in the case of expressions like 5a, xy, etc.

We can also similarly expand (a + b) c using the distributive property as follows—

(a+ b)c=c (a+ b) (commutativity of multiplication) =ca+ cb (distributivity) =ac + bc (commutativity of multiplication)

We can use the distributive property to find, in general, how mucha product increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased by 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and b. If one of the numbers, say b, is increased by 1, then we have—

(VN a(b+1)=ab~x{[a]


## Increase

Now let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are increased by 1. Ifin a product ab, both a and D are increased by 1, then we obtain (a + 1) (b+ 1).

~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 @ How do we expand this?

Let us consider (a + 1) as a single term. Then, by the distributive property, we have

(a+ 1) (b+ 1)=(a+1)b+(a+1)1 Again applying the distributive property, we obtain

If a = 23, and, b = 27, we get


## (Cw

a @+no+n-debo+@+O1 (23 + 1) (27 + 1) = (23 + 1) 27+ (23+1)1

=ab+\(b+a+1) = 23x 27+ |(27+23+1)


## Increase Increase

Thus, the product ab increases by a + b + 1 when each of a and D are increased by 1.

What would we get if we had expanded (a + 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1) as a single term? Try it?

@ What happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1 and the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product?

Let us again take the product ab of two numbers a and Db. If a is increased by 1 and b is decreased by 1, then their product will be (a + 1) (b - 1). Expanding this, we get

If a = 23, and b = 27, we get (a+ 1) (b-1) =(a+1)b-(a+1)1]} (23 + 1) (27-1) = (23 + 1) 27-(23 +1) 1

=ab+ b-(a+1) = 23x 27+27-(23 +1) =ab+[b—a-l]| = 23x 27+[27-23-1 Increase Increase

Will the product always increase? Find 3 examples where the product decreases.

?) What happens when a and b are negative integers?

Check by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above cases. For example, a =-—5, b = 8; a=-4, b=-5; etc.

We have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that is, if x, y and z are any three integers, then x (y + Z) = xy + xz.

Thus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the letter-numbers take on negative integer values as well.

Recall that two algebraic expressions are equal if they take on the same values when their letter-numbers are replaced by numbers. These


## We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply ¥

numbers could be any integers. Mathematical statements that express the equality of two algebraic expressions, such as a(b + 8) = ab + 8a, (a+ 1) (b-1)=ab+b-a-1l, etc. are called identities.

(2 By how much will the product of two numbers change if one of the

numbers is increased by m and the other by n?

If a and b are the initial numbers being multiplied, they become a+mandb+n.


## (a+m) (b+ nm =(at+mb+(a+mn =ab+mb+an+mn

The increase is an + bm + mn. Notice that the product is the sum of the product of each term of (a + m) with each term of (b + n).

This identity can be visualised as follows—


## b columns n columns


## a rows


## MmYOws

(a+m) (b+n)


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

This identity can be used to find how products change when the numbers being multiplied are increased or decreased by any amount. Can you see how this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased?

For example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased by 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b- 1) as (a+ 1) (b + (-1). Taking m = 1 and n= -1 in Identity 1, we have

ab+(1)xb+ax (-1)+ (1) x (1) =ab+b-a-1, which is the same expression that we obtain earlier. (?) Use Identity 1 to find how the product changes when (i) one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3; (ii) both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4. (?) Verify the answers by finding the products without converting the subtractions to additions. Generalising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b - v) as follows. (a+u)(b-v) =(a+wb-(a+wWv


## =ab+ ub—-(av+ uv)


## =ab+ub-av-uv.

Check that this is the same as taking m = u and n = --v in Identity 1.

As in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b-v) is the sum of the product of each term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b - v (b and (-v)). Notice that the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the usual rules of integer multiplication.

P See how the rules of integer multiplication allows us to handle multiple cases using a single identity!

@ Expand (i) (a- wu) (b + v), (ii) (a- wu) (b- Vv). We get (a-w) (b+ v) = ab-ub + av-wy, and


## (a—u) (b-v) = ab-ub-av+uv.

The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket. @ Example 1: Expand 34 (a— b + 9).

The terms can be simplified as follows—

3 3 xX a=5% (axa).

Using exponent notation, we can write 3 x (ax a= 3 a. 3ayp=3 =3 3

34,1_- 3,1 qg-3 2 X5>G* 5) a= 754

So we get 34 (qg_p+4-3@_-3 3 7 (a-~b+5)=5a’-sZab+ Ga.

?) Can any two terms be added to get a single term?

For example, can 3 ad’ and 3 abe added to get a single term?

We see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers, which would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So,

a further simplification of the expression is not possible. Recall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms.

@ Example 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b). We have (a+b) (a+ b)=(atb)a+(a+b)b=axat+bxatabt+bxb =a’+ba+ab+b’

Since ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab (or, that are like terms), and so can be added — ba+ ab=ab + ab=2ab

So we get (a + b) (a+ b) = a’ + 2ab + b*.

@ Example 3: Expand (a + b) (a’ + 2ab + b’). (a+ b) (a’+ 2ab + b’) = (a+ b)a’+ (a+ b) x 2ab + (a+ bD)b* = (ax a’) + ba’ + (a x 2ab) + (b x 2ab) + ab? + (b x b’)

The terms can be simplified as follows— ax a’= a’ (why?)


## ba’=a’b ax 2ab=2xaxaxb=2a’b bx 2ab=2xaxbxb=2ab’ bxb’=bs

So, (a + b)(a? + 2ab + b*) = a? + a’b + 2a’b + 2ab* + ab? + b®. We see that a*b and 2a’b have the same letter-numbers (or, are like terms) and so can be added—


## ee ae


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8


## og

a’b + 2a’b = (1 + 2) ab = 3a’b. Similarly, ab’ and 2ab’ are like terms and so can be added— ab? + 2ab? = (1 + 2)ab* = 3ab’.

Thus, we have (a+ b) x (a? + 2ab +b? ) = a3 + 3a’b + 3ab? + b®.


## A Pinch of History

The distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit in the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations, particularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Aryabhata (in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner extensively in their mathematical and scientific works. The first explicit statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of the property for multiplication as khanda-gunanam (multiplication by parts). His verse states, “The multiplier is broken up into two or more parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by each of these and the results added”. That is, if there are two parts, then using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c= ac+ be. In the next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method for doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we explore further in the next section.

## Fast Multiplications Using the Distributive Property

The distributive property can be used to come up with quick methods of multiplication when certain types of numbers are multiplied.

@ Use the following multiplications to find the product of a number with 11 ina single step. (a) 3874 x 11 (b) 5678 « 11 Let us take the first multiplication. 3874 x 11 = 3874 (10 + 1) = 38740 + 3874

38740 + 3874

Notice how the digits are getting added.

Let us take a 4-digit number dcba, that is, the number that has din the thousands place, c in the hundreds place, b in the tens place and a in the units place.

dcba x (10 + 1) = dcba x 10 + dcba.

Such methods of applying the distributive property to easily multiply two numbers were discussed extensively in the ancient mathematical works of Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya (750 CE) and Bhaskaracharya (Lilavati, 1150 CE). In his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta refers to such methods for fast multiplication using the distributive property as ista-gunana.


## 6.2 Special Cases of the Distributive Property


## Square of the Sum/Difference of Two Numbers

@ The area of a square of sidelength 60 units is 3600 sq. units (607) and that of a square of sidelength 5 units is 25 sq. units (5*). Can we use this to find the area of a square of sidelength 65 units?

A square of sidelength 65 can be split into 4 regions as shown in the figure—a square of sidelength 60, a square of sidelength 5, and two rectangles of sidelengths 60 and 5. The area of the square of sidelength 65 is the sum of the areas of all its constituent parts. Can you find the areas of the four parts in the figure above? 60 . 5 We get , 65° = (60 + 5)? = 60? + 5°+ 2 x (60 x5).

= 3600 + 25 + 600 = 4225 sq. units.

Let us multiply (60 + 5) x (60 + 5) using the distributive property. 60 (60 + 5) x (60 +5)=60 x 60+5x60+60x5+5x5

= 60’ + 2 x (60 x 5) +5”.

Can we use 60’ (=3600) and 5? (=25) to find the value of (60 — 5)’ or 55’? Let us approach this through geometry by drawing a square of side length 55 sitting inside a square of sidelength 60.

Area of a square of sidelength 55 is (60 - 5)’ = 55”.

60 55

60 x 60

We can get the area of the square of sidelength 55 by taking the area of the square of sidelength 60 and removing the areas of the two rectangles of sidelengths 60 and 5, ie., 60° - (60 x 5) - (5 x 60). By doing this, we remove the area of the small square of sidelength 5 twice. What can we do with this expression to get the actual area?

We can add back the area of the square of sidelength 5 to this expression. That way, we are only subtracting this area once.


## We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply a

So, (60 — 5)? = 60? — (60 x 5) — (5 x 60) + 5? = 3600 — 300 - 300 + 25 = 3025.

The area of the square of sidelength 55 is 3025 sq. units. We have seen what (a + b)? gives when expanded. What is the expansion of (a — b)’?

## Pattern 1

Look at the following pattern. 2(27+1%)=3?+ 1? 2 (3? +1’) = 4? + 2? 2(6?+5*)=11'?+ 1? 2 (5° + 3%) = 8? + 27,

a Take a pair of natural numbers. Calculate the sum of their squares. Can you write twice this sum as a sum of two squares?

Try this with other pairs of numbers. Have you figured out a pattern? Notice that 2 (5* + 6’) = (6+ 5)? + (6-5)”. Do the identities below help in explaining the observed pattern? (a+ by’ =a’ + 2ab+b’ (a-b)’ =a’ -2ab + b’ (a+ by’ + (a—b)? = (a’ + 2ab + b’) + (a’ - 2ab + b*)

Adding the like terms a’+ a’ = 2a’, b’+ b? = 2b’ and 2ab - 2ab = 0, we get

2 (a’ + b*) = (a+ b)’ + (a—-by’. Pattern 2

@ Here is a related pattern. Try to describe the pattern using algebra to determine if the pattern always holds.

9x9-1x1=10x8 8x8-6x6=14x2 7x*7-2x*x2=9%xS

10x 10-4x4=14x6

The pattern here appears to be a’ -— b? = (a+ b) x (a—b). Is this a true identity? Using the distributive property, we get

(a+ b) x (a—b) =a’ -ab+ ba-a’. Adding the like terms, ab + (-ab) = 0, we see that indeed

## Image A

Image D Image E We can see that all the images are of different sizes.

2?) Which images look similar and which ones look different? Images (A, C, and D) look similar, even though they have different sizes.

## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

©) Do images B and E look like the other three images?

No, they are slightly distorted. The tiger appears elongated in B, and compressed and fatter in E!

(?) Why?

You may notice that images A, C, and D are rectangular, but E is a square. Maybe that is why E looks different. But Bis alsoarectangle! (gt) Why does it look different from the other rectangular images?

Can we observe any pattern to answer this question? Perhaps by measuring the rectangles?


## Image Width Gn mm) | Height (in mm)


## Snape | image


## wage 0

?) What makes images A, C, and D appear similar, and B and E different?

When we compare image A with C, we notice that the width of C is half that of A. The height is also half of A. Both the width and height have changed by the same factor (through multiplication), $ in this case. Since the widths and heights have changed by the same factor, the images look similar.

When we compare image A with image B, we notice that the width of B is 20 millimetre (mm) less than that of A. The height too is 20 mm less than the height of A. Even though the difference (through subtraction) is the same, the images look different. Have the width and height changed by the same factor? The height of B is half the height of A. But the width of B is not half the width of A. Since the width and height have not changed by the same factor, the images look different.

?) Can you check by what factors the width and height of image D change as compared to image A? Are the factors the same?

Images A, C, and D look similar because their widths and heights have changed by the same factor. We say that the changes to their widths and heights are proportional.


## Proportional Reasoning-1


## 7.2 Ratios

We use the notion of a ratio to represent such proportional relationships in mathematics. We can say that the ratio of width to height of image A is

60 : 40.

The numbers 60 and 40 are called the terms of the ratio.

The ratio of width to height of image C is 30 : 20, and that of image D is 90 : 60.

So, in image A, we can say that for every 60 mm of width, there are 40 mm of height.

We can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D are proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same factor. Let us see how.

Image A — 60: 40 Multiplying both the terms by + we get 60 x 5: 40x 5 which is 30 : 20, the ratio of width to height in image C.

By what factor should we multiply the ratio 60 : 40 (image A) to get 90: 60 (image D)?

Amore systematic way to compare whether the ratios are proportional is to reduce them to their simplest form and see if these simplest forms are the same.


## 7.3 Ratios in their Simplest Form

We can reduce ratios to their simplest form by dividing the terms by their HCF.

In image A, the terms are 60 and 40. What is the HCF of 60 and 40? It is 20. Dividing the terms by 20, we get the ratio of image A to be 3:2 in its simplest form.

The ratio of image D is 90 : 60. Dividing both terms by 30 (HCF of 90 and 60), we get the simplest form to be 3 : 2. So the ratios of images A and D are proportional as well.

What is the simplest form of the ratios of images B and E? The ratio of image B is 40 : 20; in its simplest form, it is 2 : 1. The ratio of image E is 60 : 60; in its simplest form, it is 1: 1.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

These ratios are not the same as 3 : 2. So, we can say that the ratios of width to height of images B and E are not proportional to the ratios of images A, C, and D.

When two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the ratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use

the ‘:” symbol to indicate that they are proportional. So a:b::c:d indicates that the ratios a: b and c: d are proportional.

Thus, 60 : 40 :: 30: 20 and 60: 40 :: 90: 60.


## 7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning

@ Example 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72 : 96 proportional?

3: 4 is already in its simplest form. To find the simplest form of 72 : 96, we need to divide both terms by their HCF.

(2) What is the HCF of 72 and 96?

The HCF of 72 and 96 is 24. Dividing both terms by 24, we get 3: 4. Since both ratios in their simplest form are the same, they are proportional.

Example 2: Kesang wanted to make lemonade for a celebration. She made 6 glasses of lemonade in a vessel and added 10 spoons of sugar to the drink. Her father expected more people to join the celebration. So he asked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade.

To make the lemonade with the same sweetness, how many spoons of sugar should she add?

To maintain the same sweetness, the ratio of the number of glasses of lemonade to the number of spoons of sugar should be proportional. For 6 glasses of lemonade, she added 10 spoons of sugar.

The ratio of glasses of lemonade to spoons of sugar is 6 : 10. If she needs to make 18 more glasses of lemonade, how many spoons of sugar should she use? We can model this problem as —

6:10::18:? We know that each term in the ratio must change by the same factor, for the ratios to be proportional. ?) How can we find the factor of change in the ratio?

The first term has increased from 6 to 18. To find the factor of change, we can divide 18 by 6 to get 3.

162


## Proportional Reasoning-1

The second term should also change by the same factor. When 10 increases by a factor of 3, it becomes 30. Thus,

6:10:: 18: 30. So, she should use 30 spoons of sugar to make 18 glasses of lemonade with the same sweetness as earlier.

@ Example 3: Nitin and Hari were constructing a compound wall around

their house. Nitin was building the longer side, 60 ft in length, and Hari was building the shorter side, 40 ft in length. Nitin used 3 bags of cement but Hari used only 2 bags of cement. Nitin was worried that the wall Hari built would not be as strong as the wall he built because she used less cement.

?) Is Nitin correct in his thinking?

In Nitin and Hari’s case, we should compare the ratio of the length of the wall to the bags of cement used by each of them and see whether they are proportional.

The ratio in Nitin’s case is 60 : 3, ie., 20: 1 (in its simplest form). The ratio in Hari’s case is 40 : 2, i.e., 20:1 (in its simplest form).

Since both ratios are proportional, the walls are equally strong. Nitin

should not worry!

Note to the Teacher: Give more such examples that students can relate to and ask them to give reasons why they think they are correct. Engaging with these problems and finding solutions through a process of proportional reasoning should go along with learning procedures and methods to solve the problems.


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

@ Example 6: When Neelima was 3 years old, her mother’s age was 10 times her age. What is the ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age? What would be the ratio of their ages when Neelima is 12 years old? Would it remain the same?

The ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age when Neelima is 3 years old is 3 : 30 (her mother’s age is 10 times Neelima’s age). In the simplest form, it is 1:10.

When Neelima is 12 years old (i.e., 9 years later), the ratio of their ages will be 12 : 39 (9 years later, her mother would be 39 years old). In the simplest form, it is 4: 13.

When we add (or subtract) the same number from the terms of a ratio, the ratio changes and is not necessarily proportional to the original ratio.

Example 7: Fill in the missing numbers for the following ratios that are proportional to 14: 21.

142 6: 2: In the first ratio, we don’t know the first term. But the second term is 42. It is 2 times the second term of the ratio 14 : 21. So, the first term should also be 2 times 14 (the first term). Hence the proportional ratio is 28 : 42. x 2=? For the second ratio, the first term is 6.

?) What factor should we multiply 14 by to get 6? Can it ‘42 be an integer? Or should it be a fraction?

14:21


## x2

We can model this as 14y = 6. So, y = = = 3.

So, we need to multiply 21 (the second term of 14 : 21) also by the same factor 3.

21 x 3 is 9. So, the ratio is 6 : 9.

In the third ratio, the first term is 2. We can see that when we divide 14 (the first term of 14 : 21) by 7

(HCF of 14 and 21) we get 2.

If we divide 21 also by 7, we get 3. So, the ratio is 2 : 3.


## Filter Coffee!

Filter coffee is a beverage made by mixing coffee decoction with milk. Manjunath usually mixes 15 mL of coffee decoction with 35 mL of milk to make one cup of filter coffee in his coffee shop.

In this case, we can say that the ratio of coffee decoction to milk is 15 : 35.

If customers want ‘stronger’ filter coffee, Manjunath mixes 20 mL of decoction with 30 mL of

milk. The ratio here is 20 : 30. (69)

## Trairasika— The Rule of Three

@ Example 8: For the mid-day meal in a school with 120 students, the cook usually makes 15 kg of rice. On a rainy day, only 80 students came to school. How many kilograms of rice should the cook make so that the food is not wasted?

The ratio of the number of students to the amount of rice needs to be proportional. So, 120:15::80:?

?) What is the factor of change in the first term?

We can find that by dividing the terms ey = 2

The number of students is reduced by a factor of 2, On multiplying the weight of rice by the same factor, we get, 15x $= 10. So, the cook should make 10 kg of rice on that day.

The situation above is a typical example of a problem where we need to use proportional reasoning to find a solution. Four quantities are


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

linked proportionally, out of which three are known and we must find the fourth, unknown, quantity. To solve such problems, we can model two proportional ratios using algebraic notation as — a:b:c:d For these two ratios to be proportional, we know that term c should be a multiple of term a by a factor, say f, and term d should be a multiple of term b by the same factor f. So, c=fa_..(1) d=fb _ ...(2) From (1) and (2), we can say that,


## f= & and f=


## Therefore


## as

C_ >a py Multiplying both sides by ab, we get,

ab x ra =ab x a


## abx£ -abx4


## bc = ad or ad = bc

Thus, when a:b::c:d,then ad= be. This is known as cross multiplication of terms. Since ad = bc, we can show that

_ be d=].

Two ratios are proportional if their terms are equal when cross

multiplied. The fourth unknown quantity can be found through such cross multiplication.

In ancient India, Aryabhata (199 CE) and others called such problems of proportionality Rule of Three problems. There were 3 numbers given—the pramana (measure —‘a’ in our case), the phala (fruit—‘b’ in our case), and the ichchha (requisition—‘c’ in our case). To find the ichchhaphala (yield—‘d’ in our case), Aryabhata says,

“Multiply the phala by the ichchha and divide the resulting product by the pramana.” In other words, Aryabhata says, “pramana : phala :: ichchha : ichchhaphala,” therefore,


## pramana x ichchhaphala = phala x ichchha.


## Proportional Reasoning-1

Thus,

ichchhaphata = PRM “cheng P pramana

Using the cross multiplication method proposed by Aryabhata, ancient Indians solved complex problems that involved proportionality.

Example 9: A car travels 90 km in 150 minutes. If it continues at the same speed, what distance will it cover in 4 hours?

If it continues at the same speed, the ratio of the time taken should be proportional to the ratio of the distance covered. 150:90::4:?

?) Is this the right way to formulate the question?

No, because 150 is in minutes, but 4 is in hours. The second ratio should use the same units for time as the first ratio. Since 4 hours is 240 minutes, the right form is

150: 90:: 240: ?

® Example 10: A small farmer in Himachal Pradesh sells each 200 g packet of tea for %200. A large estate in Meghalaya sells each 1 kg packet of tea for 800. Are the weight-to-price ratios in both places proportional? Which tea is more expensive?


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

The ratio of weight to price of the Himachal tea is 200 : 200.

What is the weight to price ratio of the Meghalaya tea? Is it 1 : 800? This would not be appropriate, because we considered the weight in grams in the case of Himachal. So, the weight to price ratio is 1000 : 800 in Meghalaya after we convert the weight to grams.

To check if the ratios are proportional, we need to see if both ratios are the same in their simplest forms.

The Himachal tea ratio in its simplest form is 1: 1. The Meghalaya tea ratio in its simplest form is 5 : 4. So, the ratios are not proportional.

(©) Which tea is more expensive? Why?

| Note to the Teacher: Encourage a discussion on the more expensive tea, how they | | came to their conclusions and what the reasons for that tea being more expensive 1 | could be. ' 1 !

To answer the question as to which tea is more expensive, we should compare the price of tea for the same weight in both places. What is the price of 1 kg of tea from Meghalaya? It is $800.

In Himachal, if 200 g of tea costs rupees 200, what is the cost of 1 kg

of tea? Let us say that the price of 1 kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is A of 1 kg. So, $% Xx = 200.

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get ex xXx 5 = 200% 5

=x xXx 5 = 1000 x = 1000. So, the cost of 1 kg of tea is €800 in Meghalaya and 1,000 in Himachal

Pradesh. Therefore, the tea from Himachal Pradesh is more expensive.

## 7.5 Sharing, but Not Equally!

? Activity 3: Form a pair. Collect 12 countable objects or counters (it can be coins, seeds, or pebbles). Now, share them between the two of you in different ways.

?) If you divide them equally, what is the ratio of the number of counters with each of you?

Each of you will get 6 counters. So, the ratio is 6 : 6, or 1: 1 in its simplest form.

Now let us not share equally.

If your partner gets 5 counters, how many objects will you get? What is the ratio of the counters?


## Proportional Reasoning-1

The ratio of the counters of your partner to yours is 5: 7.

Now, if you want to share the counters between the two of you in the ratio of 3: 1, how many counters would each of you get?

Share the counters in different ways and see which combination is in the ratio 3:1. One way to share the counters in the ratio of 3: 1 is as follows —

1. Your partner takes 3 counters and you take 1 counter. There are now 8 counters left.

2. Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. There are now 4 counters left.

3. Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. There are no more counters left.

So, your partner gets 9 counters in total and you get 3 counters. When we divide 12 counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 between two people, one gets 9 counters and the other gets 3 counters.

You need to divide 42 into groups such that your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups.

?) What is the size of each group?

If your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups, the total number of groups is 7. So, the size of each group is 42 + 7 = 6.

In general, when we want to divide a quantity, say x, in the ratio m:n, we do the following:

1. We need to split x into groups such that it can be divided into two

parts where the first part has m groups and the second part has n groups.

2. But what is the size of each group? This can be found out by dividing x by the number of groups. The number of groups are m + n. So, the

‘ x size of each group is —7— .

3. So, the first part has m x i 7 objects and the second part has n x ay a objects.

Thus, if we want to divide a quantity x in the ratio of m: n, then the

4 x x parts will be m x =7, andn x —7—. We see that

2 Example 11: Prashanti and Bhuvan started a food cart business near their school. Prashanti invested 75,000 and Bhuvan invested %25,000. At the end of the first month, they gained a profit of 4,000. They decided that they would share the profit in the same ratio as that of their investment. What is each person’s share of the profit?

The ratio of their investment is 75000 : 25000.

Reducing this ratio to its simplest form, we get 3: 1.

3 + 1is 4 and dividing the profit of 4000 by 4, we get 1000.

So, Prashanti’s share is 3 x 1000 and Bhuvan’s share is 1 x 1000.

So, Prashanti would get €3,000 and Bhuvan would get %1,000 of the profit.

Example 12: A mixture of 40 kg contains sand and cement in the ratio of 3: 1. How much cement should be added to the mixture to make the

(174) ratio of sand to cement 5 : 2?


## Proportional Reasoning-1

Let us find the quantity of sand and cement in the original mixture. The ratio is 3: 1 and the total weight is 40 kg.

So, the weight of sand is a 3 7 x 40= 30 kg.

The weight of cement is Gg 1 zy x 40= 10 kg.

The weight of sand is the same in the new mixture. It remains 30. But the new ratio of sand to cement is 5 : 2. So the question is,

5:2::30:?

If the ratio is 5 : 2, then the second term is 2 times the first term. Since the new ratio is equivalent to 5 : 2, the second term in the new ratio should also be 2 times of 30.

2x 30 = 12.

The new mixture should have 12 kg of cement if the ratio of sand to cement is to be 5: 2.

There is 10 kg of cement already. So, we need to add 2 kg of cement to the original mixture.

## 7.6 Unit Conversions

We have noticed earlier that solving problems with proportionality often requires us to convert units from one system to another. Here are


## Ganita Prakash | Grade 8


## a few important unit conversions for your reference.

Length 1 metre = 3.281 feet Area 1 square metre = 10.764 square feet 1 acre = 43,560 square feet 1 hectare = 10,000 square metres 1 hectare = 2.471 acres Volume 1 millilitre (mL) = 1 cubic centimetre (cc) 1 litre = 1,000 mL or 1,000 cc Temperature

Temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius is a bit more complicated. 0°C = 32°F, and

Fahrenheit = 2 x Celsius + 32 and

Celsius = 3 x (Fahrenheit-32)

For example, 25°C is 77°F. 2 Figure it Out

The mass of equal volumes of gold and water are in the ratio 37 : 2. If 1 litre of water is 1 kg in mass, what is the mass of 1 litre of gold?

It is good farming practice to apply 10 tonnes of cow manure for 1 acre of land. A farmer is planning to grow tomatoes in a plot of size 200 ft by 500 ft. How much manure should he buy? (Please refer to the section on Unit Conversions earlier in this chapter).

A tap takes 15 seconds to fill a mug of water. The volume of the mug

is 500 mL. How much time does the same tap take to fill a bucket of water if the bucket has a 10-litre capacity?

One acre of land costs €15,00,000. What is the cost of 2,400 square feet of the same land?

A tractor can plough the same area of a field 4 times faster than a pair of oxen. A farmer wants to plough his 20-acre field. A pair of oxen takes 6 hours to plough an acre of land. How much time would it take if the farmer used a pair of oxen to plough the field? How much time would it take him if he decides to use a tractor instead?

The @10 coin is an alloy of copper and nickel called ‘cupro-nickel’. Copper and nickel are mixed in a 3: 1 ratio to get this alloy. The mass of the coin is 7.74 grams. If the cost of copper is $906 per

kg and the cost of nickel is 1,341 per kg, what is the cost of ' these metals in a %10 coin?

Ratios in the form of a : b indicate that for every ‘a’ unit of the first quantity, there are ‘b’ units of the second quantity. ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the terms in the ratio.

their terms change by the same factor, i.e., if ad = be.

If x is divided into two parts in the ratio m:n, then the quantity of the

first part is m x _*— and the quantity of the second part is n x —*_. mtn mtn

Binairo, also known as Takuzu, is a logic puzzle with simple rules. Binairo is generally played on a square grid with no particular size. Some cells start out filled with two symbols: here horizontal and vertical lines. The rest of the cells are empty. The task is to fill cells in such a way that:

1. Each row and each column must contain an equal number of horizontal and vertical lines.

2. More than two horizontal or vertical lines can’t be adjacent.

3. Each row is unique. Each column is unique.
