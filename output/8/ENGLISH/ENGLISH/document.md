## FOREWORD

The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured students’ inherent abilities, touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the parfichakoSas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8.

The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow as they advance in lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India—Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 8 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems, and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural, and geographical landscapes wherein students are sure to find traces of their lived experiences.

Poorvi also weaves into its contents snippets from the vast treasure-trove of Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, and embeds values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender equality, digital skills, etc. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its Curricular Goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, develop among them the core competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing by intelligently designing various activities around them, thereby seamlessly integrating vocabulary and grammar within meaningful contexts.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

## ABOUT THE BOOK

Poorvi, textbook of English for Grade 8, has been developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression, and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage.

Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles in developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies. The NCF-SE 2023 has stated the following Curricular Goals:

CG-1: Develops independent reading, comprehension, and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles, and news reports).

CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings, and experiences of social events.

CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing, and responding.


## CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature.

CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression.

CG-6: Develops an appreciation of the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language (pp. 245-246).

The Curricular Goals have been covered through a variety of themes and an array of activities. There are five thematic units that comprise stories, poems, conversations, and narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes, such as wit and wisdom, values and dispositions, mystery and magic, environment, and science and curiosity have been included. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated into all the units. Each unit has three literary pieces—story, poem, and conversation, or non-fictional writing. There are in-text questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, and more.

Unit 1—‘Wit and Wisdom’ celebrates intelligence, humour, and critical thinking. ‘The Wit that Won Hearts’ introduces students to the kingdom of Krishnadeva Raya and legendary courtier Tenali Rama known for his wit and problem-solving skills. The poem, ‘A Concrete Example’ by Reginald Arkell highlights irony and satire in everyday situations. A rock garden may be a thing of beauty for someone, and it may not catch the attention of someone else. The play, ‘Wisdom Paves the Way’ presents a thought-provoking scenario where different perspectives lead to unique solutions. It appreciates the role of wisdom, reasoning, and critical thinking in resolving conflicts.

Unit 2—‘Values and Dispositions’ emphasises that true strength lies in courage, kindness, and responsibility. ‘A Tale of Valour: Major Somnath Sharma and The Battle of Badgam’ teaches students the values of courage, duty, and patriotism, showing how selflessness and commitment to one’s country can make a lasting impact. The poem, ‘Somebody’s Mother’ by Mary Dow Brine, focuses on values of kindness, empathy, and the importance of helping others. It teaches that small acts of kindness can bring great comfort to those in need. ‘Verghese Kurien —-I Too Had a Dream’ encourages young people to not only pursue personal success but also contribute to the greater good of the society, reinforcing the value of serving one’s community with honesty and perseverance.

Unit 3—‘Mystery and Magic’ highlights the power of intelligence, the wonders of creativity and the breathtaking marvels of nature. ‘The Case of the Fifth Word’ by Donald J. Sobol emphasises that keen attention to detail and critical thinking can help uncover hidden truths and solve mysteries. The poem, ‘The Magic Brush of Dreams’, revolves around creativity, kindness, and the power of art. The poem teaches that talent should be used for good, emphasising generosity and the impact of imagination in shaping the world. ‘Spectacular Wonders’, explores India’s unique and mysterious natural wonders, highlighting the enigmatic charm that each place unfolds.

Unit 4— ‘Environment’ encourages students to nurture a bond with nature and express gratitude for the bountiful gifts it offers. ‘The Cherry Tree’ by Ruskin Bond is a story that emphasises the importance of nurturing and the rewards of perseverance. It also teaches us to appreciate the small miracles of life and value our deep connection with nature. The poem, ‘Harvest Hymn’ by Sarojini Naidu, reflects the hardwork of farmers and their deep faith in the land and the divine forces. It signifies the harmony between humans and nature, portraying the harvest as a sacred and joyous occasion. ‘Waiting for the Rain’, by Kamakshi Balasubramanian, is a story that captures the vagaries of nature, and its impact on farming. It also highlights the wisdom in understanding the natural cycle of renewal and balance.

Unit 5— ‘Science and Curiosity’ sparks curiosity about the wonders of science, technology, and discovery. ‘Feathered Friend’ by Arthur C. Clarke explores companionship beyond human relationships through the story of a bird in space. The poem, ‘Magnifying Glass’ by Walter de la Mare, encourages students to explore perception and mystery. ‘Bibha Chowdhuri: The Beam of Light that Lit the Path for Women in Indian Science’ highlights renowned scientists and their contributions, promoting discussions on scientific advancements.

These literary pieces serve not only as sources of entertainment but also as repositories of valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth, and equipping children with skills to navigate social situations with confidence. By resonating with children’s daily experiences, the selected pieces promote positive values such as resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence, thereby exerting a profound impact on their overall development.

The primary focus lies in cultivating competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing while concurrently developing vocabulary and grammar in context. Language learning truly comes to life when connected to the immediate environment of learners, allowing them to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences through experiential learning. All the activities are conveniently colour coded under headings, such as ‘Let us discuss’, ‘Let us think and reflect’, ‘Let us learn’, ‘Let us listen’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us write’, and ‘Let us explore’. ‘Let us Explore’ extends learning beyond the text, staying within the unit’s theme. It aims to connect students with the Indian Knowledge System, fostering an appreciation for our rich heritage and culture, encouraging students to delve deeper, engage in meaningful discussions, and broaden their understanding. In-text activities and exercises at the end of each chapter are thoughtfully designed to be engaging, fostering joyful learning experiences while serving as tools for assessment and learning. Illustrations have been carefully crafted to depict the relevant context and enhance comprehension.

We sincerely hope that students will enjoy doing these activities, and develop language competencies.

The textbook of English for Grade 8 is titled Poorvi after the Indian raga ‘Poorvi’. This raga is said to promote harmony and serenity. It is associated with dusk, specifically sunset time (Sandhi Prakash). Each raga in Indian music carries its own emotional significance and is symbolically connected to certain seasons, times of day, and moods. Ragas are believed to evoke specific emotions in listeners.

Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical raga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning.

Let us read

The Vijayanagara Empire was renowned for its glory, wealth, and cultural achievements. Among its many illustrious rulers, King Krishnadeva Raya (ruled 1509-29 CE) stood out as a wise and powerful monarch. His reign is often referred to as the Golden Era of the Vijayanagara Empire, a time when art, literature, and architecture flourished. A great patron of learning, Krishnadeva Raya was not only an eminent warrior but also a gifted poet. His works, such as the epic Amuktamalyada and the Sanskrit drama Jambavati Parinayam, are acclaimed even today.

Krishnadeva Raya’s court was home to eight celebrated poets, collectively known as the Ashtadiggajas. These poets, including Allasani Peddana and Tenali Ramakrishna, enriched the literary tradition with their masterpieces. Tenali Ramakrishna, in particular, was known for his quick wit and humour, earning him a special place in the king’s court as both a poet and a witty advisor. His clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems made him a beloved figure in the empire’s history.

Even the wisest rulers face moments of disharmony, and at one such time, the king hada quarrel with his queen, Thirumalambal, over a seemingly trivial matter. For weeks, he did not utter a single word to her, and in his frustration, stopped visiting her altogether. His absence cast a shadow over the palace, and the once cheerful corridors seemed quiet and forlorn.

Thirumalambal, distraught and upset, tried her best to resolve the issue but failed. With no other alternative, she

decided to seek the help of Tenali Rama, the court’s brilliant and witty poet. Rama listened patiently as the queen recounted the incident in detail.

“The king wrote a poem,” she began, her voice trembling. “It was filled with vague expressions—sun, moon, stars, beautiful sky—but it made no sense. When he tried

reciting it to his ministers, they all avoided him, making excuses. It was late evening when he came to me, seeking an audience. He began reciting it to me, but I was so exhausted after a tiring day that I yawned— not once, but several times. The king thought I was disrespecting his poem and stormed off. Since then, he has not spoken to me. If I had known this would happen I would have chosen another day. Help me, please, Rama. Only you can help the king understand.”

Rama nodded thoughtfully. “If you like, I will try my best to resolve this matter, Your Highness. But this needs a well-planned approach, and I may need time to find the right strategy.” The queen, who had placed her last hope in Rama, agreed and thanked him profusely.

The next morning, the royal court was bustling with activity.

Ministers, scholars, and courtiers filled the courtroom, its

intricately carved pillars towering towards the high ceiling. Rays of sunlight streamed through the open windows, illuminating the floor adorned with exquisite rugs. Despite the lively chatter, a tension hung in the air. The king sat on his ornate throne, his expression stern, his sharp eyes scanning the room. It was evident that the unresolved quarrel still gnawed at him.

The court discussion was centred on improving paddy cultivation in the empire. One by one, the ministers rose to present their ideas. Some suggested expanding irrigation networks, while others advocated for better manure. Amid these suggestions, Tenali Rama stood quietly at the edge of the court, observing everyone with an amused smile.

Finally, the king called upon Rama. The chatter in the court died down as all eyes turned to him. Rama approached the throne, carrying a plateful of paddy seeds. Bowing low, he began, “Your Majesty, I bring you a revolutionary type of paddy seeds. If these are sown, the yield will be three times greater than the current results.”

A murmur swept through the room. One of the courtiers, known for his sarcasm, whispered just loud enough to be heard, “I wonder if these are magic seeds! Next, he’ll claim they grow without water.” Another muttered, “Perhaps he found them on the moon!” Snickers rippled through the court.

The king frowned, unimpressed. “That sounds absurd,” he muttered. “Such cultivation would need special soil, manure, and pest and insect repellents. If, by chance, something were to go wrong, our farmers would suffer.”

Rama smiled, unfazed. “That may be true, Your Majesty, but the real issue lies not with the seeds themselves but with the person who sows them.”

A hush fell over the court as Rama’s words hung in the air. The king’s eyebrows furrowed. “What is wrong with the person who sows the seeds? Speak clearly, Rama!” he roared.

Rama glanced around the court, his sharp gaze meeting the sceptical eyes of the courtiers. “If one were to sow seeds without proper care, no one would reap a good harvest,” he said, pausing for effect. “And what if the person had a habit of yawning while sowing? Wouldn’t the seeds scatter unevenly?”

The court erupted into laughter, the earlier sarcasm replaced by genuine amusement. Even the king, caught off guard, sighed and instinctively yawned. Rama watched him keenly, then continued, “Your Majesty, is there anyone in this world who does not yawn? It is as natural as breathing.”

The king’s expression shifted as realisation dawned. His mind raced back to the quarrel with the queen. He remembered scolding her harshly for yawning while he recited his poem. He realised how unfair he had been. “IfI had known that yawning was not a sign of disrespect, I wouldn’t have taken her gesture so personally,” he thought, regret filling his heart.

I Read the narrative essay given below. A Lesson in Responsibility

One bright Monday morning, I woke up to the sounds of birds chirping loudly. For once, I wasn’t late for school. My uniform was neatly laid out, and my homework was already packed in my bag. I felt proud of myself for being so organised. But little did I know, the day would still teach me an important lesson.

During the morning assembly, our teacher, Mrs. Rao, announced a surprise Science quiz. My heart skipped a beat. I had studied the chapter a week ago, but I had forgotten to revise it over the weekend. As I sat at my desk with the question paper in front of me, I froze. The questions looked familiar, yet I couldn’t recall the answers clearly. I tried my best to focus, but it wasn’t enough. Later, when the results were announced, I scored much lower than I expected. Disappointed, I spoke to Mrs. Rao after the class. She smiled and said, “It’s not about how much you know but how consistently you prepare. Small efforts add up every day.”

Her words stayed with me. From that day on, I made it a habit to revise my lessons regularly, even if there wasn’t an immediate test. Responsibility isn’t just about being on time or finishing tasks—it’s about being ready for what’s unexpected.

## Scene I: The Road to Ujjain

(Four young men—Ram Datt, Shiv Datt, Har Datt, and Dev Datt—are walking along a dusty road leading to Ujjain. They appear travel-worn but resolute, their eyes fixed on the city that looms ahead. The sun is high, and the distant noise of the bustling city faintly reaches them.)

Dev DaTr_ : Ten days are but a short span in the grand scheme of things. We may still have many more roads to wander before we find employment befitting all four of us.

RaM DatTT : If only we could secure an audience with the King of Ujjain. I am confident he would recognise our talents and appoint us to his service.

SHIV DATT : We have not seen your camel, not even once.

MERCHANT : (Indignant) How can that be? You speak of my

camel as if it stood before you, yet you dare to claim not to have seen it! You are deceivers! You must have stolen it and sold it off. I will take this matter to the King himself.

DEV DaTT_ : You are free to do as you wish, sir. If the King

desires our presence, we shall be waiting under that banyan tree yonder.

MERCHANT : Ido not trust your words. I will not leave you here

to slip away. You shall come with me to face the King!

: Inoticed small droplets of blood along the track,

likely from mosquito bites. A camel with a long tail would have fended off these pests with ease. These small specks told me of an animal lacking such defence, hence the short tail.

: (Impressed) You reasoned with great insight,

showing both observation and deduction. (Turning to Dev Datt) And you, what did you observe that set you apart from your companions?

: I noticed, Your Majesty, that the prints of the

camel’s forefeet were deep and clear, while those of the sound hind foot were faint. This indicated that the camel was drawing up its hind legs, likely due to discomfort. It moved cautiously, burdened by a pain in its belly, trying to spare itself further suffering with every step.

: (Marvelling) Extraordinary! You have not seen the

camel, yet you know it intimately. Your reasoning is flawless and speaks of wisdom that goes beyond mere sight. (Turning to the Merchant) Your accusations are baseless and misguided. These are men of wisdom, not thieves. Go, and continue your search for your camel, and be mindful of whom you accuse in the future.

(The Merchant, chastened and embarrassed, bows deeply and exits, his face red with shame.)

: (To the four men) You have demonstrated

remarkable intelligence and the ability to see beyond the obvious. Such minds are rare and highly valued in my court. I extend to you the honour of becoming my advisers. Your counsel shall guide my decisions, and your wisdom shall be a beacon for my kingdom. What do you say to my offer?

I You will listen to a woman narrating a story. As you listen, fill in the blanks for the following sentences given below by selecting the correct options.

Hello everybody! Today I’ll be narrating a story about a quick-witted courtier in the kingdom of Vijayanagara.

A renowned scholar, proud of his abilities, once visited the kingdom of Vijayanagara. You see, he wanted to challenge the scholars in the court of King Krishnadeva Raya. The court scholars did not want to accept the challenge as they were worried of being defeated by the visitor. Besides this, they were also afraid that the king would be angry if they refused to face the scholar.

They knew that only the quick-witted Tenali Rama would be able to manage the situation. So, naturally, they asked him for a solution. As expected, Rama told them that he would accept the challenge.

The next day, Rama arrived at the palace. Rama and the challenger sat facing each other. There was a bundle wrapped in silk kept near Rama. He placed his hand on the bundle and said to the visitor, “Let us start by discussing the merits of tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana”. The visitor was taken aback. He had read thousands of works. But he had never heard of this work. He had no idea what to say. The scholar had to accept his defeat. Ashamed, he quietly left the palace.

2 ~

Now, the king was curious to know about the great work Rama had mentioned. Rama smiled and removed the silk cloth. There was a huge bundle of sticks tied with a thick rope! The king was puzzled and asked for an explanation.

&) 1.

Rama told him, “O king! til is sesame; kashta is stick, tilakashta means sticks of sesame plants”. Then, displaying the rope Rama said, “This is the rope used to tie a buffalo—mahisha means buffalo, bandhana means the rope used for tying—so, this is


## : tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana.”

The king burst out laughing. The poor visitor had become scared hearing such a difficult name. In this way, Rama had taught the arrogant scholar a lesson.

The Rock Garden is spread across a massive 40-acre wonderland. Do you know why I say this? Well, it is because it has several colourful sculptures and mosaic of art pieces.

What is unique about the Rock Garden is that it is divided into three distinct phases. Each area reveals a unique collection of installations including terracotta pots, light fixtures, and even broken toilet pots, that have been transformed into extraordinary masterpieces.

: I love witty characters because they make serious

situations funny! Even when things seem tense, they always have aclever response. Such characters never panic, think fast, and solve problems in the smartest way. I wish I could think that quickly!

Witty characters are the best because they make stories exciting. I especially like how they turn ordinary moments into something memorable. It makes me feel like intelligence and humour are just as powerful as strength.

I enjoy witty characters because they always have an answer for everything! They use humour instead of fighting, and that’s really wonderful. Even in folktales, they prove that smart thinking can win over force. It makes me laugh but also teaches me to stay calm in tricky situations.

Witty characters add charm to a story. Their intelligence keeps the reader engaged, and their humour makes learning fun. Whether it’s a folktale or a modern one, a clever character always stands out. I often feel that wit and wisdom go hand-in-hand!

If they had succeeded, it would have allowed them to control strategic mountain passes, peaks, and rivers. On 22 October, Operation Gulmarg was launched and these infiltrators invaded Kashmir, which led to the Princely State becoming a part of India on 26 October 1947.

In response to this invasion, the Government of India sent its troops to defend the people of Kashmir and India’s borders on 27 October 1947. A contingent of troops posted to Jammu and Kashmir was airlifted into Srinagar because the land route through Pathankot was not in a good condition.

On 31 October, the D Company of the 4th Battalion of Kumaon Regiment, under the command of Major Somnath Sharma, was also flown into Srinagar. At that time, Major Somnath Sharma’s left hand was in plaster, but he insisted on being with his company while in combat. He knew that this mission would be very challenging and told his senior officers, “I know my men better than anyone else, and if they are going into action, they are not going in without me.” These words highlighted his commitment to his men and his country.

Before their arrival in Srinagar, there had been unfounded rumours of tribal movement towards the village of Badgam, less than 5 kilometres away from the Srinagar airport. The village was on a higher altitude than the airfield, and access was through the village. Hence, it was important for Indian forces to retain control of the area in order to protect troops and facilitate supplies arriving via air.

In reality, the enemy had started arriving in Badgam in small groups to avoid detection. On 03 November 1947, several companies, including Major Somnath Sharma’s D Company, were sent to patrol and assess emerging threats in and around the village. Throughout the day, the valley was eerily silent. Around afternoon, the companies were ordered to return one by one. D company with 90 soldiers was the last, and they were expected to return by 2:00 p.m.

When the enemy (tribal guerrilla invaders), under the command of the Pakistani army, saw that only a small group


## VALUES AND DISPOSITIONS

of Indian soldiers were left behind in Badgam, they attacked them. Their initial attack was met with stiff resistance by Major Somnath and his men. However, Major Somnath correctly visualised that the first attack was just a distraction. Shortly thereafter, a major attack came from another side. By then, Major Somnath Sharma and his 90 soldiers were facing about 500 invaders.

The Pakistani invaders sought to capture the Srinagar airfield and its surrounding areas. It was clear to Major Somnath Sharma that defending Srinagar town, the airfield, and the wider valley was indeed difficult until reinforcements arrived.

After assessing the situation, he requested air strikes. He bravely laid out ground panels to guide the aircraft towards their target. The aerial attacks were successful in hitting the tribal invaders, but they still outnumbered D Company by almost seven to one, the attack on the positions occupied by Major Somnath’s men continued.

Vastly outnumbered and facing devastating fire, Major Somnath Sharma and his men stood resolute. The air was thick with the sound of gunfire and the cries of battle, but Major Somnath Sharma’s voice cut through the chaos, urging his men to fight with tenacity and valour.

Despite heavy casualties and his own injuries, Major Somnath Sharma displayed unparalleled bravery. He moved fearlessly through the battlefield, directing fire, filling magazines for his gunners, and encouraging his men to hold their ground.

However, as the battle progressed, D Company began running out of ammunition. When Major Somnath Sharma informed Brigade headquarters about this, he was asked to pull back. Aware of the gravity of the situation, he responded with the words, “The enemy is only 50 yards from us. We are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight to the last man and the last round”.

Just a few minutes later, when he was crouched in a trench next to a machine gun operator, in order to help him load the gun, his position was hit bya mortar shell, killing him instantly.

Despite losing their Major and faced with the overwhelming numerical superiority of the enemy, the heroic actions of late Major Somnath Sharma motivated his men to hold on to their position for over six more hours before being overrun by the enemy.

Their brave resistance provided time for reinforcements to arrive, including flying in soldiers from the Punjab regiment to Srinagar. The heroic deeds of Major Somnath and his men thoroughly demotivated the enemy, causing more than 300 casualties, including injuring their leader.

In many significant ways, D Company’s sacrifice and Major Somnath’s leadership saved Srinagar for India. The 4 KUMAON battalion was awarded the Battle Honour, Srinagar. Major Somnath laid down his life for the nation at the young age of 24. For this act of conspicuous bravery, Major Somnath Sharma was awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC). His citation reflects his heroism, patriotism, and courage. He was the first recipient of the PVC, awarded posthumously for gallantry and supreme sacrifice.

## CITATION IN RESPECT OF IC-521 MAJOR SOMNATH SHARMA

On 03 Nov 1947, Major Somnath Sharma's company was ordered on a fighting patrol to Badgam in the Kashmir Valley. He reached his objective at first light on 03 Nov and took up a position south of Badgam at 1100 hours. The enemy, estimated at 500, attacked his company position with three sides, the company began to sustain heavy casualties.

Fully realizing the gravity of the situation and the direct threat that would result to both the aerodrome and Srinagar if the enemy attack was not held until reinforcements could be rushed to close the gap leading to Srinagar via Humhama, Major Sharma urged his company to fight the enemy tenaciously. With extreme bravery, he kept rushing across the open ground to his sections exposing himself to heavy and accurate fire to urge them to hold on. Keeping his nerve, he skillfully directed the fire of his section into the ever- advancing enemy. He repeatedly exposed himself to the full fury of enemy fire and laid out cloth strips to guide our aircraft onto their target in full view of the enemy.

Realising that casualties had affected the effectiveness of his light automatics, this officer, whose left hand was in plaster, personally commenced filling magazines and issuing them to light machine gunners. A mortar shell landing right in the middle of the ammunition resulted in an explosion that killed him.

Major Sharma's company held onto its position and the remnants withdrew only when almost completely surrounded. His inspiring example resulted in the enemy being delayed for six hours. Thus, gaining time for our reinforcements to get into position at Humhama to stem the tide of the enemy advance. His leadership, gallantry and tenacious defence were such that his men were inspired to fight the enemy by seven to one for six hours, one hour which was after this gallant officer had been killed.

He has set an example of courage and qualities seldom equaled in the history of the Indian Amy.

## TO MY GRANDSON

Anand, 2005 My dear Siddharth,

When did I write to you last? I have trouble even remembering! In today’s fast-paced world we have become so addicted to instant communication that we prefer to use a telephone. But speaking on the telephone only gives us an immediate but fleeting joy. Writing is different. Writing— even if it is a letter—not only conveys our present concerns and views of the events taking place around us but it becomes a possession that can be treasured and re-read over the years, with great, abiding pleasure.

You may not wish to read it all right away but, perhaps, a couple of decades or more from now, you will pick up these jottings of mine again and they will give you a deeper understanding of what I have done, and the reasons I pursued a life of service to our nation’s farmers. You will then discover in them a valuable reminder of the days just before the world entered the twenty-first century. And you may want to share my memories with those of your generation, or even younger, to provide a glimpse of the world your grandparents lived in and knew.

I started my working life soon after our country became independent. The noblest task in those days was to contribute in whatever way we could towards building an India of our dreams—a nation where our people would not only hold their heads high in freedom but would be free from hunger and poverty. A nation where our people could live with equal respect and love for one another. A nation that would eventually be counted among the foremost nations of the world. It was then that I realised, in humility, that choosing to lead one kind of life means putting aside the desire to pursue other options. This transformation took place within me fifty years ago, when I agreed to work for a small cooperative of dairy farmers who were trying to gain control over their lives.

To be quite honest, service to our nation’s farmers was not the career I had envisioned for myself. But somehow, a series of events swept me along and put me in a certain time with a choice that would transform my life. I could have pursued a career in metallurgy and become the

chief executive of a large company. Or, opted for a commission in the Indian Army and maybe retired as a general. Or, I could have left for the US and gone on to become a highly successful NRI. Yet, I chose none of these because somewhere, deep down, I knew I could make a more meaningful contribution by working here in Anand, Gujarat.

Your grandmother too made an important choice. She knew, in those days, life in Anand could not offer even the simple comforts that we take for granted today. However, she ardently supported my choice to live and work in Anand. That choice of your grandmother to stand by me has given me an everlasting strength, always ensuring that I shouldered my responsibilities with poise.

Whenever I have received any recognition for my contributions towards the progress of our country, I always emphasised that it is a recognition of the achievements of many people with whom I had a privilege to be associated with. I would like to stress even more strongly that my contributions have been possible only because I have consistently adhered to certain values. Values that I have inherited from my parents and other family elders; values that I saw in my mentor and supporter here in Anand—Tribhuvandas Patel. I have often spoken of integrity as the most important of these values, realising that integrity—and personal integrity, at that—is being honest to yourself. If you are always honest to yourself, it does not take much effort in always being honest with others.

I have also learnt what I am sure you, too, will find out some day. Life is a privilege and to waste it would be wrong. In living this privilege called ‘life’, you must accept responsibility for yourself, always use your talents to the best of your ability and contribute somehow to the common good. That common good will present itself to you in many forms every day. If you look around you, you will find there is a lot waiting to be done: your friend may need some help, your teacher could be looking for a volunteer, or the community you live in will need you to make a contribution. I hope that you, too, will discover, as I did, that failure is not about not succeeding. Rather, it is about not putting in your best effort and not contributing, however modestly, to the common good.

In life you, too, will discover as I did, that anything can go wrong at any time and mostly does. Yet, there is little correlation between the circumstances of people’s lives and how happy they are. Most of us compare ourselves with someone we think is happier—a relative, an acquaintance, or often, someone we barely know. But when we start looking closely we realise that what we saw were only images of perfection. And that will help us understand and cherish what we have, rather than what we don’t have.

The highlighted punctuation is a long dash that can be used to link words or numbers or to create a pause in a sentence. There are two main types: the shorter en dash (-) and the longer em dash (—).

The en dash (-) represents a span or range in numbers or dates.

For example, it can indicate time periods, like ‘train operates June-— September’ or page numbers, such as ‘refer to pages 50-75’ or to show scores, ‘India won the series 2-1’.

The em dash (—) is used to add extra information or to show a change in thought within a sentence. For example, ‘The exhibition—held in the main hall—features local artists.’ Or ‘I bumped into someone unexpected—my old teacher.’

Note: Do not add spaces around the dash and avoid overusing them.

## Ill Financial Literacy

Read the passage and discuss the questions given below.

Financial literacy is an essential lifelong skill that should be taught to children from an early age. Preparing children with financial literacy skills is an investment for their future well-being. By imparting an understanding of money, saving, budgeting, and wise spending, we empower them to navigate the financial world with confidence as they grow up.

Whether it is managing a cooperative society, a start-up, or a household budget, financial literacy is an ongoing learning process that evolves as children grow and their understanding deepens. An introduction to concepts of saving, budgeting, investing, and responsible spending equips them with essential life skills.

Children learn best through practical examples. Real-life situations help them understand the value of money and the importance of making wise financial choices. Thinking critically before spending helps cultivate responsible habits. The concept of saving and investing can be explained through relatable examples, such as planting seeds that grow into trees bearing fruit.

As children grow older, they will learn to differentiate between needs and wants, compare prices before making a purchase and understand importance of financial literacy.


## Discuss in groups.

1. The importance of learning about money and saving from a young age. Share one example of it.

2. Imagine you received some money as a gift. How would you decide whether to save it, spend it, or invest it? What factors would you consider?

3. If you were in charge of planning a small event at school with a limited budget, how would you manage the money?

4. Why is financial literacy important for everyone?

## Hello, everyone!

Let me tell you about the Param Vir Chakra. It is one of the most prestigious awards in India and signifies the ‘Wheel of the Ultimate Brave.’ This award is granted for ‘exemplary bravery in the presence of the enemy.’ This means that this award is given to someone who shows extraordinary courage and bravery while fighting the enemy.

The medal was instituted as a Gallantry Medal with retrospective effect from 15 August 1947 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the then President of India. The medal was designed by Mrs. Savitri Khanolkar, who drew inspiration from Sage Dadhichi, a Vedic rishi, who made the ultimate sacrifice by giving up his body so that the gods could create a deadly weapon called Vajra, or Thunderbolt, from his spine.

, The Param Vir Chakra is cast in bronze. At its centre, on a raised circle, is the State Emblem of India. Surrounding it are four replicas of Indra’s Vajra, lined with lotus flowers.

I You will listen to the passage about Evelyn Glennie’s journey in overcoming her hearing loss through music and turning a physical disability into a success story.

Evelyn Glennie’s loss of hearing had been gradual. By the time she was 11 her performance in school had deteriorated and her headmistress urged her parents to take her to a specialist. It was then discovered that her hearing was severely impaired as a result of gradual nerve damage. “Everything suddenly looked black,” says Evelyn. But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was determined to lead anormal life and pursue her interest in music. One day she noticed a girl playing a xylophone and decided that she wanted to play it too. Most of the teachers discouraged her but percussionist Ron Forbes spotted her potential. He began by tuning two large drums to different notes. “Don’t listen through your ears,” he would say, “try to sense it some other way.” Says Evelyn, “Suddenly I realised I could feel the higher drum from the waist up and the lower one from the waist down.” Forbes repeated the exercise, and soon Evelyn discovered that she could sense certain notes in different parts of her body. “I had learnt to open my mind and body to sounds and vibrations.” She explains, “It pours in through every part of my body. It tingles in the skin, my cheekbones and even in my hair.” The rest was sheer determination and hard work. She never looked back : from that point onwards. And she got right to the top, the world’s most sought-after multi percussionist with a mastery of some thousand instruments.

## POORVI

Encyclopedia Brown is a young boy who lives in Idaville, USA. His father is the Chief of Police. In spite of being so young he often helps his father solve mysteries that even the police find difficult to solve. Their discussions are generally held at the dining table. Read this story to find out how the boy wonder solves a case that has been troubling his father...

Encyclopedia’s father was Chief of Police. Everyone thought that he must be the smartest police chief in the country. Chief Brown was smart and quick. He didn’t sit around and worry. When he came up against a case he couldn’t solve, he acted at once. He cleared his desk, put on his hat, and went home to dinner. Encyclopedia solved the case for him before dinner was over.

Chief Brown would have liked to tell everyone about his only child. But who would believe him? Who would believe that the best detective alive was an eighth grader? So, he said nothing.

Encyclopedia never spoke of the help he gave his father. He didn’t want to seem different from other boys. But there was nothing he could do about his nickname. He was stuck with it.

Only his parents and teachers called him by his real name, Leroy. Everyone else called him Encyclopedia.

An encyclopedia is a book or set of books filled with facts from A to Z. So was Encyclopedia’s head. He read more books than

anyone in Idaville, and he never forgot a fact. His pals said he was like a library and computer rolled into one, and more user-friendly.

At the dinner table on Tuesday night, Chief Brown stared at his cream-of-mushroom soup. Encyclopedia and his mother knew what that meant. He had a mystery he could not solve.

“Tim Nolan died yesterday,” he announced in a matter-of-fact manner.

“That name is familiar,” Mrs. Brown said. “Wasn’t he mixed up in a jewellery robbery a few years ago?”

“Five years ago,” Chief Brown replied. “Two masked men held up the Diamond Mart on Sixth Avenue. They got away with a million dollars worth of jewellery.”

“I thought Tim Nolan was arrested,” Mrs. Brown said. “He was questioned, not arrested,” Chief Brown corrected.

“I always believed that Nolan and a friend, a man named Daniel Davenport, pulled the hold-ups. There wasn’t any proof, though.”

Encyclopedia sat quietly. He knew his mother and father were discussing the case for his benefit.

His father filled in the facts.

“Nolan and Davenport had met,” Chief Brown said, “while both were in prison in South Carolina. They became friendly because of shared interests. Nolan was let out first. He settled in Idaville and started a small palm-tree nursery. It barely yielded him a living.”

“Davenport came

gunman’s mask slipped. A clerk thought she recognised Nolan. But she wasn’t absolutely sure.”

“I remember now,” Mrs. Brown said. “The clerk refused to testify against him, and no trace of the stolen jewellery ever turned up.”

“Davenport hasn’t been seen since the hold-up,” Chief Brown said. “My hunch is that he and Nolan decided to hide the loot until things cooled down.”

“Didn’t you search Nolan’s house, dear?”

“I got a court order this morning,” Chief Brown said. “Officers Lewis and Maloney just about took Nolan’s house apart. They didn’t find one piece of the stolen jewellery.”

“Is there some mystery about Nolan’s death yesterday?” Mrs. Brown inquired.

“Yes and no,” Chief Brown answered. “Nolan suffered from a bad heart for many years. Yesterday morning he had a stroke. He must have realised he was dying. With his last strength, he managed to put his will on the kitchen table. It leaves everything he owns, including his palm-tree nursery to Davenport.”

Let us discuss

II Do you think Chief Brown would need Leroy’s help to solve this case? If yes, why? If no, why not?

I “What’s suspicious about that?” Mrs. Brown asked.

“Nothing about the will itself—just about a sheet from his desk calendar. It was clipped to the will,” said Chief Brown.

He took out his pocket notebook and leafed through the pages.

“T copied what Nolan wrote on the sheet,” he said. “Here it is.”

He handed the notebook to Mrs. Brown.

She read what he had copied. “It has Davenport’s name and address,” she said, “and a few words I don’t understand.”

She handed the notebook to Encyclopedia. “What do you make of the four words, Leroy?”

Encyclopedia read the four words below Davenport’s name and address: Nom Utes Sweden Hurts.

Mrs. Brown looked at him hopefully. Usually he needed to ask only one question to solve a case before dessert.

They were still on the soup.

Encyclopedia leaned back and closed his eyes when he did his hardest thinking.

After several seconds, he opened his eyes and asked his question. “Is there a young fir tree in Mr. Nolan’s palm-tree nursery?” Chief Brown thought a moment. “Yes, there is... one. On the south side of the house. How did you know?”

“The four words say so,” Encyclopedia answered.


## “They do?” said Chief Brown.

“See for yourself,” Encyclopedia urged.


## Chief Brown studied the four words: Nom Utes Sweden Hurts.

He shook his head and passed the notebook to Mrs. Brown again. “Can you figure it out?”

“As Dad said, Davenport and Nolan must have hidden the stolen jewellery. Probably not a week or so ago, Nolan changed the hiding place.”

“You think that he tried to tell Davenport by phone and failed to reach him?” Mrs. Brown asked. “So he wrote the four words as he was dying?” Chief Brown nodded. “We’ll find Davenport now that we know his address.”

“He’ll learn he has been left the palm-tree nursery,” Mrs. Brown said. “And the four words will tell him where the jewellery is hidden!”

“Leroy!” Mrs. Brown exclaimed. “What do the four words mean?”

“You already guessed, Mom. They tell where the jewellery is hidden.”

>)

Mrs. Brown looked ready to explode with impatience, “Where?”

Encyclopedia smiled. “Why, under the fifth word,” he said. What Was The Fifth Word?

»

106

To tell Davenport where he had hidden the stolen jewellery, Nolan wrote a four-word code.

As the key to the code, he wrote the four words on a sheet from a desk calendar.

The four words stood for days of the week.

Nolan dropped the letters d-a-y. Then he used the other letters to form words.

So, Nom = Monday, Utes = Tuesday, Sweden = Wednesday and Hurts = Thursday.

The unwritten fifth word was Fir, or Friday.

The jewellery was found inside a twenty-gallon jug of earth from which grew the young fir tree in Nolan’s nursery—just as Encyclopedia had foreseen.

## My Life as EcoFlash

Imagine an ordinary 13-year-old student who is also a secret superhero protecting the environment. That’s my life as EcoFlash! By day, ’m Meenu, an ordinary Grade 8 student. By evening, I use my powers to keep my neighbourhood green and clean.

As EcoFlash, I have the ability to grow plants, purify water, and clean polluted air with a wave of my hand. I wear a green suit with a glowing leaf symbol and carry a small seed pouch that holds magic seeds to restore damaged areas. My mission is to fight pollution, save trees, and educate people about taking care of our planet. My friends wonder why I’m always carrying a plant in my bag or why my shoes are muddy, but I can never tell them the truth.

Once, my little brother saw me turning a garbage dump into a beautiful garden and almost spilled my secret to our parents. I had to convince him it was a magic trick!

Being EcoFlash is not just about powers but also responsibility. Every time I see clean streets, blooming flowers, and children playing in green parks, I feel proud. I know that even small changes can make a big difference, and that’s what keeps me going.

India is home to some of the most mystifying natural phenomena that surprise and spark our imagination.

1. THE VALLEY oF FLowers, UTTARAKHAND

The Valley of Flowers is an eye- catching spectacle with around 600 species of exotic flowers, including orchids, poppies, primulas, marigold, daisies, and anemones. It is a place where nature blooms in its full glory offering an attractive view. The trek to the valley offers spectacular views of beautiful waterfalls and wild streams. The valley is also home to rare wildlife species like the grey langur, flying squirrel, red fox, lime butterfly, and snow leopard, to name a few.

With a stunning backdrop of the mighty Himalayan ranges, the Valley of Flowers National Park presents an unforgettable experience for visitors. Spread over a huge area in the Chamoli district, the Valley of Flowers National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Between the months of May and October, this area turns into a botanical wonderland!

2. THE Livinc Root Bripces, MEGHALAYA

Imagine building a_ bridge without the use of cement, stones, concrete, etc. Is it possible? The living root bridges are incredible feats of engineering built by the indigenous people of Meghalaya. The living root bridges are one of Meghalaya’s most beautiful tangible UNESCO world heritage sites.

Crossing the many waterways without bridges was difficult for people in the past, during monsoons.

Attempts to use bamboo or wooden bridges across these waterways proved futile as these bridges could not last long in the heavy rains and strong waters. Living root bridges are an innovative and indigenous solution to solve this age-old problem.

They are made of intertwined roots which are a sort of magic, but they aren’t imaginary. These bridges have been built for centuries by the indigenous people of the land. It is a naturally built ecosystem oflocal flora. Italso symbolises the relationship and knowledge that the local people have over their region and the cultural significance that it holds for them. Under ideal conditions, a root bridge is thought to be able to persist for hundreds of years. These bridges frequently rise 50 to 100 feet in the air. The state’s longest living root bridge is said to be a whopping 175 feet in length. There are approximately 100 or so known living root bridges across different villages.

3. THe Lonar CRATER LAKE, MAHARASHTRA


## a. eel The Lonar Crater Lake is a

geological wonder, nestled in the town of Lonar in Buldhana district, Maharashtra. It is believed to have been formed thousands of years ago. This ancient landform, consisting of a giant hole, came into existence when a colossal meteorite, blazing at an extremely high speed, crashed into the Earth, leaving behind a stunning mark. It is the only crater in India formed in basaltic rock by a meteorite impact and ranks as the third largest in the world, placing it among the top five largest craters globally.

The crater’s perfectly circular depression cradles a unique saline lake at its core, creating a striking visual contrast against the surrounding rugged terrain. This site is a rare and extraordinary blend of celestial impact and terrestrial beauty. The rim of the meteor crater offers a breath-taking spectacle of nature’s power and the enduring allure of our planet’s ancient past.

4. Macnetic HILts In LEH DISTRICT, LADAKH

In the travels around Leh-Ladakh, is a fascinating sight which arouses curiosity to no end—the Magnetic Hill, a place where gravity takes a backseat!

Lying at a distance of around 30 km from Leh, the Magnetic Hill is marked by a yellow signboard which reads ‘The Phenomenon That Defies Gravity’. It also instructs visitors to park vehicles in the box marked with a white point on the road, which is known as the Magnetic Road. When the vehicles are parked at the indicated spot, they begin moving forward at a speed of almost 20km/h. This unusual place creates an optical illusion where vehicles appear to roll uphill, a sight that has left tourists in disbelief for years, caused by the peculiar alignment of surrounding slopes and the horizon line.

5. GLowING WaTERS OF KERALA

Situated 15 kms from Kerala’s

Kochi town, Kumbalangi is a beautiful village with vast green vegetation.

In the serene backwaters of Kumbalangi village, one can see magically glowing waters in the night.

This phenomenon is called bioluminescence, and is caused by a high concentration of micro-planktons in the sea, which are small organisms found in marine and freshwater. This beautiful sight has captured the attention of locals as well as tourists, making Kumbalangi an eco-tourism village in India. One can experience the village life in all its beauty and simplicity, and acquaint oneself to their cuisine and culture.

6. THE SUNDARBANS

Can a forest exist in a coastal zone? Yes, they are called mangrove forests, where trees take root under water in the low-oxygen soil. The roots slow down the movement of tidal waters, stabilising the coastline and reducing erosion. The Sundarbans is one such mangrove forest spread over 1,400 kms in West Bengal, lying in the delta of rivers, such as the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna. The name is derived from sundari trees that are plentiful in the area.

The area is also populated by an extensive range of flora and fauna, including many bird species, the majestic Bengal tiger, and other threatened species, such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.

7. THE INVISIBLE CHANDIPUR BEACH, ODISHA

Have you_ seen __ things disappearing in front of your eyes? Well, such things happen at times, when we keep things at some place, and just forget where we have kept them. But, what if there’s a sea that disappears?

This happens in Odisha. It is a beach in the Balasore district where one can witness the sea disappearing mysteriously—the Chandipur Beach which is known for its unique feature of playing hide-and-seek with its visitors.

The sea can actually be witnessed disappearing and reappearing. This is because the sea water moves. It retreats by 2-5 km during ebb tide, the duration between the high tide and low tide, and comes back to the shore at the time of high tide. This unusual natural phenomenon keeps on happening

I You will listen to a podcast about ways of improving observation skills. a As you listen, mark true or false for the statements 1-4. ;

Hello everyone! In today’s episode, we’ll be discussing some simple but effective ways to improve our observation skills. Being observant isn’t just about seeing, it’s about truly noticing details in the world around us. Whether it’s in daily life or in the workplace, observation skills can help us become more aware, make better decisions, and even improve memory. Let’s get started!

First, slow down and take your time. Rushing through tasks often 4 \ leads to missed details. When you take time to focus on what’s

in front of you, you’re more likely to notice features you might

otherwise overlook. When you pause and observe, the details


## become clearer.

Another effective method is to engage all your senses. Observation isn’t just about seeing; it’s also about hearing, smelling, touching, and even tasting. The more senses you engage, the more information you absorb. For example, when you’re in a new environment, don’t just look around—pay attention to sounds, smells, and textures too.

observers because they actively try to understand what they’re noticing. Asking questions about what you see, like “Why is this here?” or “What purpose does it serve?” forces your brain to think critically about what you’re observing.

A third tip is to ask questions. Curious people tend to be better is 4 \

Next, take notes or make sketches. Writing down what you observe can help reinforce details in your memory. Even quick sketches of an object or place can strengthen your understanding of its features.

Finally, it’s important to practise mindfulness. Mindfulness helps

~ - you stay present in the moment and fully engage with your

} &) ~ surroundings. When you’re mindful, you’re not distracted by ‘es anything, this leads to improved observation skills.

a Start incorporating these techniques into your daily routine, and soon you'll be observing things you never noticed before!

ry One - when Rakesh was six, he walked home from the Mussoorie bazaar eating cherries. They were a little sweet, a little sour; small, bright red cherries, which had come all the way from the Kashmir Valley.

Here in the Himalayan foothills where Rakesh lived, there were not many fruit trees. The soil was stony, and the dry cold winds stunted the growth of most plants. But on the more sheltered slopes there were forests of oak and deodar.

Rakesh lived with his grandfather on the outskirts of Mussoorie, just where the forest began. His father and mother lived in a small village fifty miles away, where they grew maize and rice and barley in narrow terraced fields on the lower slopes of the mountain.

But there were no schools in the village, and Rakesh’s parents

stunted: stopped were keen that he should go to school. As soon as he was of

cherries. He paid fifty paise for the bunch. It took him about - half-an-hour to walk home, and by the time he reached the cottage there were only three cherries left.

‘Have a cherry, Grandfather,’ he said, as soon as he saw his grandfather in the garden.

Grandfather took one cherry and Rakesh promptly ate the other two. He kept the last seed in his mouth for some time,

rolling it round and round on his tongue until all the tang had gone. Then he placed the seed on the palm of his hand and studied it.

‘Are cherry seeds lucky?’ asked Rakesh.


## ‘Of course.’ ‘Then Ill keep it.’

‘Nothing is lucky if you put it away. If you want luck, you must put it to

some use.’ ‘What can I do with a seed?’

Plant it.’

So Rakesh found a small space and began to dig up a flowerbed.

‘Hey, not there,’ said Grandfather. ‘I’ve sown mustard in that bed. Plant it in that shady corner, where it won’t be disturbed.’

Rakesh went to a corner of the garden where the earth was soft and yielding. He did not have to dig.

He pressed the seed into the soil with his thumb and it went right in.

Then he had his lunch, and ran off to play cricket with his friends, and forgot all about the cherry seed.

When it was winter in the hills, a cold wind blew down from the snows and went whoo-whoo-whoo in the deodar trees, and the garden was dry and bare.

In the evenings Grandfather and Rakesh sat over a charcoal fire, and Grandfather told Rakesh stories—stories about people

## POORVI

who turned into animals, and ghosts who lived in trees, and beans that jumped and stones that wept—and in turn, Rakesh would read to him from the newspaper, Grandfather’s eyesight being rather weak. Rakesh found the newspaper very dull— ae, especially after the stories—but Grandfather wanted all the news...

They knew it was spring when the wild duck flew north again, to Siberia. Early in the morning, when he got up to chop wood and light a fire, Rakesh saw the V-shaped formation streaming northward, the calls of the birds carrying clearly through the thin mountain air.

One morning in the garden he bent to pick up what he thought was a small twig and found to his surprise that it was well rooted. He stared atitforamoment,then . ran to fetch Grandfather, calling, ‘Dada, come and look, the cherry 7 tree has come up!’

‘What cherry tree? asked Grandfather, who had forgotten about it. ‘The seed we planted last 2% year—look, it’s come up!’

‘What are the pebbles for?’ asked Grandfather. ‘For privacy,’ said Rakesh.

He looked at the tree every morning but it did not seem to be — growing very fast, so he stopped looking at it except quickly, out of the corner of his eye. And, after a week or two, when, he allowed himself to look at it properly, he found that it had grown—at least an inch!

That year the monsoon rains came early and Rakesh plodded: walked plodded to and from school in raincoat and chappals. Ferns sprang from the trunks of trees, strange-looking lilies came up in the long grass, and even when it wasn’t raining the trees dripped and mist came curling up the valley. The cherry tree grew quickly in this season.

It was about two feet high when a goat entered the garden and ate all the leaves. Only the main stem and two thin branches remained.

‘Never mind,’ said Grandfather, seeing that Rakesh was upset. ‘It will grow again, cherry trees are tough.’

Let us discuss

Towards the end of the rainy season new leaves appeared on the tree. Then a woman cutting grass scrambled down the hillside, her scythe swishing through the heavy monsoon foliage. She did not try to avoid the tree: one sweep, and the cherry tree was cut in two.

When Grandfather saw what had happened, he went after the woman and scolded her; but the damage could not be repaired. ‘Maybe it will die now,’ said Rakesh.

sowing. He was thinner but stronger when he came back to Grandfather’s house at the end of the rains to find that the cherry tree had grown another foot. It was now up to his chest.

Even when there was rain, Rakesh would sometimes water the tree. He wanted it to know that he was there.

One day he found a bright green praying-mantis perched ona branch, peering at him with bulging eyes. Rakesh let it remain there; it was the cherry tree’s first visitor.

The next visitor was a hairy caterpillar, who started making a meal of the leaves. Rakesh removed it quickly and dropped it on a heap of dry leaves.

‘Come back when you're a butterfly,’ he said.

Winter came early. The cherry tree bent low with the weight of snow. Field-mice sought shelter in the roof of the cottage. The road from the valley was blocked, and for several days there was no newspaper, and this made Grandfather quite grumpy. His stories began to have unhappy endings.

In February it was Rakesh’s birthday. He was nine—and the tree was four, but almost as tall as Rakesh.

One morning, when the sun came out,

Grandfather came into the garden to let

put it. He stopped in front of the cherry tree, stared at it for a few moments, and then called out, ‘Rakesh! Come and look! Come quickly before it falls!’

Rakesh and Grandfather gazed at the tree as though it had performed a miracle. There was a pale pink blossom at the end of a branch.

The following year there were more blossoms.

And suddenly the tree was taller than Rakesh, even though it was less than half his age. And then it was taller than Grandfather, who was older than some of the oak trees.

But Rakesh had grown too. He could run and jump and climb trees as well as most boys, and he read a lot of books, although he still liked listening to Grandfather’s tales.

In the cherry tree, bees came to feed on the nectar in the

blossoms, and tiny birds pecked at the blossoms and broke them off. But the tree kept blossoming right through the spring, and there were always more blossoms than birds.

That summer there were small cherries on the tree. Rakesh tasted one and spat it out.

‘It’s too sour,’ he said.

‘They'll be better next year, said Grandfather.

But the birds liked them—especially the bigger birds, such as the bulbuls and scarlet minivets—and they flitted in and out of the foliage, feasting on the cherries.

On a warm sunny afternoon, when even the bees looked sleepy, Rakesh was looking for Grandfather without finding him in any of his favourite places around the house. Then he looked out of the bedroom window and saw Grandfather reclining on a cane chair under the cherry tree.

‘There’s just the right amount of shade here,’ said Grandfather. ‘And I like looking at the leaves.’

‘They're pretty leaves,’ said Rakesh. ‘And they are always ready to dance, if there’s a breeze.’

After Grandfather had come indoors, Rakesh went into the garden and lay down on the grass beneath the tree. He gazed up through the leaves at the great blue sky; and turning on his side, he could see the mountains striding away into the clouds.

He was still lying beneath the tree when the evening shadows crept across the garden. Grandfather came back and sat down beside Rakesh, and they waited in silence until the stars came out and the nightjar began to call. In the forest below, the crickets and cicadas began tuning up; and suddenly the trees were full of the sound of insects.

‘There are so many trees in the forest,’ said Rakesh. ‘What’s so special about this tree? Why do we like it so much?’

‘We planted it ourselves,’ said Grandfather. ‘That’s why it’s special.’

‘Just one small seed,’ said Rakesh, and he touched the smooth bark of the tree that he had grown. He ran his hand along the trunk of the tree and put his finger to the tip of a leaf. ‘I wonder,’ he whispered. ‘Is this what it feels to be God?’

“I hope it rains at least today,” Velu thought, as he opened his eyes.

Velu was a farmer. The sun was beginning to rise, glowing crimson like fire. Velu scanned the sky. There was not a cloud.

“It doesn’t look encouraging,” he muttered to himself and got up.

Rain or no rain, a farmer wakes up early. Velu worked hard. His piece of land never failed him. Season after season he cultivated it, harvesting jowar one season and dhal the next. Throughout the year he worked, never thinking of rest or taking a holiday. For nearly six years it had been so, ever since he had got his own piece of land.

But this year turned out to be different. At the end of summer, the rains didn’t come. Velu and his neighbours waited, but their waiting didn’t end. Days, weeks and months passed, and still there was no rain.

The fields lay untended, the earth hardened, crusted and cracked. The barren land looked forlorn and the farmers lived cInyrely on hope. Every day =

“What are you smiling at, Amma?” Velu asked. “Without the rains, there’s nothing to smile about.”

“Yes, yes, you’re right,” the old woman said, the smile leaving her lips.

“Yes, my son, that is the difficulty. You don’t realise that the earth is old... But Nature is a mother to all of us. To you and to me. And to the trees, the water and the soil. She takes care to give her children the rest they need...”

Velu began to understand.

“When the rains don’t come, you are dejected. But in that way the land is left alone. The land lies undisturbed, staring at the sky, resting.. And when the rains come, it will spring back into activity, fresh and ready for your crop. Go home, my son, Nature knows a thing or two.. go home,” she said, and got up.

She walked away. After a while Velu, too, got up and walked home-ward. He thought about the land, his beloved piece of land, which, if he were to believe the old woman, was perhaps ¢ breathing peacefully, taking auabreak from the constant, ceaseless year-round cultivation.

I Listen to this talk about paddy cultivation. As you listen, number the events in the correct order in which they happen.


## Hello everyone!

Did you know that rice is actually a type of grass, and the part we eat is its seed? Let me tell you about the process of cultivating rice.

It all starts with preparing the land. First, the soil has to be ploughed. Rice is typically grown in fertile soil that holds a lot of water. The most important step in preparing the soil is to soak it with plenty of water. This step is called puddling. Once the nursery bed is prepared, the seeds can be planted. After that, we sow the seeds on the soil’s surface.

Paddy farmers have to ensure that their fields stay flooded with water because irrigation is crucial. It takes around 4 to 5 weeks for the seeds to grow into seedlings. After this comes the most important step—transplanting. The seedlings that were prepared in the nursery bed are uprooted and then transplanted into the flooded field.

In around 120 days, the rice plants are fully grown. At this . point, the crops are harvested by cutting them. Following : this, the seeds are separated from the plant. This is called VI threshing. To reduce the moisture content even more, the - ” separated grains are dried. This ensures that they can be &

stored or processed further. Through a process called milling, the rice is separated from the outer covering on it.

Finally, the rice reaches the market, and that’s where we get it to make all kinds of delicious foods. Whether it’s Appam, Pulao, Khichdi, or Daal Bhaat, rice is a big part of many meals.

## SCIENCE AND CURIOSITY


## I

To the best of my knowledge, there’s never been a regulation that forbids one to keep pets in a space station. No one ever thought it was necessary—and even had such a rule existed, Iam quite certain that Sven Olsen would have ignored it.

Actually he was a wiry little fellow, like most of the early spacers, and managed to qualify easily for the 150-pound bonus that kept so many of us on a reducing diet. Had he been built otherwise, his chances of getting a job in space would have been very slim.

Sven was one of our best construction men, and excelled at the tricky and specialised work of collecting assorted girders as they floated around in free fall, making them do the slow-motion, three-dimensional ballet that would get them into their right positions, and fusing the pieces together when they were precisely dovetailed into the intended pattern: it was a skilled and difficult job, for a space suit is not the most convenient of garbs in which to work. However, Sven’s team had one great advantage over the construction groups you see putting up skyscrapers down on Earth. They could step back and admire their handiwork without being abruptly parted from it by gravity.

Don’t ask me why Sven wanted a pet, or why he chose the one he did. I’m not a psychologist, but I must admit that his

selection was very sensible. Claribel weighed practically nothing, her food requirements were tiny—and she was not worried, as most animals would have been, by the absence of gravity.

I first became aware that Claribel was aboard when I was sitting in the little cubbyhole laughingly called my office, checking through my lists of technical stores to decide what items we’d be running out of next. When I heard the musical whistle beside my ear, I assumed that it had come over the station intercom, and waited for an announcement to follow. It didn’t; instead, there was a long and involved pattern of melody that made me look up with such a start that I forgot all about the angle beam just behind my head. When the stars had ceased to explode before my eyes, I had my first view of Claribel.

She was a small yellow canary, hanging in the air as motionless as a hummingbird—and with much less effort, for her wings were quietly folded along her sides. We stared at each other for a minute; then, before I had quite recovered my wits, she did a curious kind of backward loop I’m sure no earthbound canary had ever managed, and departed with a few leisurely flicks. It was quite obvious that she’d already learned how to operate in the absence of gravity, and did not believe in doing unnecessary work.

Sven didn’t confess to her ownership for several days, and by that time it no longer mattered, because Claribel was a general pet. He had smuggled her up on the last ferry from Earth, when he came back from leave—partly, he claimed, out of sheer scientific curiosity. He wanted to see just how a bird would operate when it had no weight but could still use its wings.

Claribelthrived and grew fat. On the whole, we had little trouble concealing our guest when VIPs from Earth came visiting. A space station has more hiding places than you can count; the only problem was that Claribel got rather noisy when she was upset, and we sometimes had to think fast to explain the curious peeps and whistles that came from ventilating shafts and storage bulkheads.

There were a couple of narrow escapes—but then who would dream of looking for a canary in a space station?

“Where’s Sven?” I asked, not very much caring.

“He’s looking for Claribel,” someone answered. “Says he can’t find her anywhere. She usually wakes him up.”

Before I could retort that she usually woke me up, too, Sven came in through the doorway, and we could see at once that something was wrong. He slowly opened his hand, and there lay a tiny bundle of yellow feathers, with two clenched claws sticking pathetically up into the air.

“What happened?” we asked, all equally distressed.

“T don’t know,” said Sven mournfully. “I just found her like this.”

“Let’s have a look at her,” said Jock Duncan, our cook-doctor-dietitian. We all waited in hushed silence while he held Claribel against his ear in an attempt to detect any heartbeat.

Presently he shook his head. “I can’t hear anything, but that doesn’t prove she’s dead. I’ve never listened to a canary’s heart,” he added rather apologetically.

“Give her a shot of oxygen,” suggested somebody, pointing to the green-banded emergency cylinder in its recess beside the door. Everyone agreed that this was an excellent idea, and Claribel was tucked snugly into a face mask that was large enough to serve as a complete oxygen tent for her.

To our delighted surprise, she revived at once. Beaming broadly, Sven removed the mask, and she hopped onto his finger. She gave her series of “Come to the cookhouse, boys” trills—then promptly keeled over again.

“I don’t get it,” lamented Sven. “What’s wrong with her? She’s never done this before.”

For the last few minutes, something had been tugging at my memory. My mind seemed to be very sluggish that morning, as if I was still unable to cast off the burden of sleep. I felt that I could do with some of that oxygen—but before I could reach the mask, understanding exploded in my brain. I whirled on the duty engineer and said urgently: “Jim!” There’s something wrong with the air! That’s why Claribel’s passed out. I’ve just remembered that miners used to carry canaries down to warn them of gas.”


## SCIENCE AND CURIOSITY

“Nonsense!” said Jim. “The alarms would have gone off. We’ve ~@ got duplicate circuits, operating independently.” 7

“Er—the second alarm circuit isn’t connected up yet,” his assistant reminded him. That shook Jim; he left without a word, while we stood arguing and passing the oxygen bottle around like a pipe of peace.

He came back ten minutes later with a sheepish expression. It was one of those accidents that couldn’t possibly happen; we’d had one of our rare eclipses by Earth’s shadow that night; part of the air purifier had frozen up, and the single alarm in the circuit had failed to go off. Half a million dollars’ worth of chemical and electronic

engineering had let us down completely. Without Claribel,

we should soon have been slightly dead. inexplicable:

. Sleep: Astronauts can sleep on a floor, wall, or ceiling as there’s no

distinction between up and down but they may gradually float away while sleeping. Therefore, they need to restrain their bodies in small sleeping compartments or sleeping bags.

Did you know that animals can save humans from natural calamities? Animals can sense natural calamities. Read the following examples and decide if this is true.

In 2004, before a tsunami could hit the coastline of Indonesia, some animals made efforts to flee—elephants ran for higher ground, flamingos abandoned low-lying nesting areas, and dogs refused to go outdoors.

Minutes before the Naples quake of 1805, oxen, sheep, dogs, and geese started making alarm calls in unison.

Migratory birds crossing the Pacific are able to dodge storms and other hazards.

In the Gulf of Mexico, sharks sense the drop in barometric pressure that precedes hurricanes and tend to swim to deeper waters as a result. Dolphins have also been observed swimming away from storm-prone areas.

Scientists have studied this behaviour and found that when severe stresses arise in deep rock before the earthquake, ultra-low frequency electromagnetic waves are generated that animals can sense.

IV Salim Ali, the ‘Birdman of India’, was an Indian ornithologist (a person who studies birds). He was the first Indian to conduct systematic bird surveys across India and wrote several books on birds. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1958 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1976.

In a world where women’s potential in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is being recognised beyond doubt, India has seen its share of trailblazers who paved the way. Today, the women behind ISRO’s Mars Orbiter Mission and Chandrayaan-3 are celebrated for their brilliance and achievements. However, the foundation was laid by early pioneers like Bibha Chowdhuri—India’s first woman physicist—who carved a path in the male-dominated field of physics.

At a time when Indian women struggled to seek knowledge and equitable access to education, Bibha Chowdhuri emerged as a rare beam of light—a woman who defied the odds and lit a path for others to follow. Born in 1913 in Kolkata, in an India that still followed the traditional path. Bibha’s story was anything but ordinary. She was a scientist who rose not only against the societal expectations of women but also amidst the towering giants of science—men whose names the world would come to celebrate, while hers was whispered only in the halls of those who recognised her brilliance.

Bibha’s persistence eventually earned her a place at the Bose Institute. She had already begun to chip away at the walls of exclusion, becoming the first Indian woman to excel in high-energy particle physics.


## Breaking Boundaries

In 1945, Bibha’s academic journey took her to the University of Manchester. Under the guidance of the celebrated Nobel Laureate, Patrick M.S. Blackett, she delved deeper into the field of cosmic rays. Her Ph.D. thesis on cosmic rays earned local recognition, with newspapers introducing her as ‘India’s

Her nomination for a Nobel Prize in 1950 by Erwin Schrédinger, though unsuccessful, reflected her remarkable talent. Her life, full of challenges and struggles, was marked by an uphill battle to be heard and seen in the field of science. Chowdhuri never received any awards during her lifetime, but continued her work tirelessly. =

## The Legacy of Bibha Chowdhuri and Today’s Women in Indian Science

The stars are not meant to remain hidden forever. In 2019, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) honoured her legacy by renaming a star in the constellation Leo—HD 86081—as ‘Bibha,’ meaning ‘beam of light.’ Fittingly, she is now a ‘star in heaven,’ a symbol of the light she brought to Indian science. A fitting tribute

## POORVI

to a woman whose life was a radiant example of tenacity, brilliance, and quiet determination. In 2020, the Government of India declared a chair professorship in her name.

Fast forward to the present day, and the advancements made by women in Indian science reflect Chowdhuri’s pioneering spirit and the progress she helped ignite. Women in ISRO, for instance, are no longer participants but leaders in missions that make global headlines.

One such luminary is Dr. Ritu Karidhal Srivastava, popularly referred to as the ‘Rocket Woman of India.’ Her pivotal role in ISRO’s Mars Orbiter Mission and subsequent leadership in Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3 reflect the leaps women have made in STEM in India. Over 50 women contributed to Chandrayaan-3, and their success is built upon the shoulders of pioneers like Bibha Chowdhuri. Their roles in developing autonomous systems for spacecraft and managing mission-critical operations highlight the capabilities of women in pushing India’s space programme forward.


## From Shadows to the Stars

The journey from Bibha Chowdhuri’s era to today’s women scientists has been long and arduous, but it is also inspiring. The struggles Chowdhuri faced are a stark reminder of how far we’ve come—and how much further we have to go. But with every cosmic achievement—be it landing on the moon or reaching Mars—these women prove that the journey is well worth it.

Bibha Chowdhuri’s legacy lives on. Her story continues to inspire young women to pursue their passions, break barriers, and leave their mark on the world. Whether exploring cosmic rays or sending rockets to Mars, India’s women scientists are writing the next chapter in a story that Bibha Chowdhuri helped begin.

As the stars of Indian science shine brighter, Bibha Chowdhuri, the beacon-‘beam of light,’ will always guide the way.

I In the recent times, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are changing the way students learn. Let us know more about them.

« Augmented reality (AR) enhances a person’s environment by adding digital elements to what can be seen in real time, usually through a smartphone camera.

Virtual reality (VR) offers a fully immersive experience, replacing the real world with a simulated one.

Through AR and VR, the students can see and interact with things that they could not interact with in real life. This enables younger students to understand difficult ideas easily.

To keep up with the times, NCERT has developed the e-Pathshala AR (Augmented Reality) App under the aegis of MHRD, Government of India.

This App aims to enable students to go beyond textbooks and four walls of the classrooms and learn concepts by directly experimenting rather than only through reading and memorisation.

This revolutionary effort will change most students from passive listeners to active learners.

This effort is in line with the Prime Minister’s Digital India vision to empower varied sectors using technology and addressing the triple need of skill, scale, and speed.

DAUGHTER :

Papa, everyone talks about how yoga and the concept of zero came from India, but I recently found out there are so many more inventions that people don’t really know about!


## Oh really? Like what?

Well, did you know that radio broadcasting has roots in India? We usually credit Marconi, but Jagadish Chandra Bose, a Bengali scientist, actually conducted an experiment using microwaves before Marconi.

Wow, I didn’t know that! That’s incredible. I can recollect something about fibre optics.

Yes! You’re absolutely right Papa. Can you imagine life without fibre optics? No fast internet, no clear communication... And guess what? It was pioneered by Narinder Kapany, an Indian physicist from Punjab. He’s called the ‘father of fibre optics.’

That’s something I use every day, but I just had an

idea that the origins were in India. What about fun things? Any of those that you’ve found out about?

Yes indeed! You’ll love this one—Snakes and Ladders! It was actually invented as a game to teach children values, with ladders representing virtues and snakes representing evil. It wasn’t just a board game like we think today. It had a spiritual meaning in ancient times.

FATHER : So even that simple game had such deep roots. Let me tell you about one that I just remembered.

DAUGHTER : Of course! I’d love to know.

FATHER : Well, the USB port, something we rely on all the time to connect devices, was invented by Ajay Bhatt. He’s an Indian-born engineer who helped revolutionise the way we use technology.

DAUGHTER : That’s amazing. USB is such a basic part of life now. It’s hard to imagine a time without it.

FATHER : That’s incredible. And all this from India. I definitely learned a lot from this conversation.
