The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains ofhuman endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured students’ inherent abilities, touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pafichakoSas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8.

The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow as they advance in lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India— Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed in providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. The book for Physical education and well- being, titled Khel Yatra for Grade 8, is meticulously designed to develop motor skills and engage children in the team sports of Athletics, Table Tennis and Volleyball. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage.

Khel Yatra emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness.

The content and activities are designed to encourage peer group learning, and enrich the educational experience for both students and teachers. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore interesting local games and play with friends. This book is not only useful for school learning, but is a valuable resource for parents and community.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. Schoollibraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further

improvement in the coming years. DinesH PRASAD SAKLANI Director

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 (NCF-SE 2023) recognises the criticality of the health and wellbeing of individuals as a key factor for success in all aspects of life. Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 8. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities.

To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 8 textbook is designed to have the following six units.

1. Foundations of Physical Education and Well-being

2. Physical and Motor Fitness

3. Fundamental Skills of Athletics

4. Fundamental Skills of Table Tennis

5. Fundamental Skills of Volleyball

6. Yoga

In Unit 1, students explore the connection between physical education (PE) and well-being, emphasising its impact on personal and social

behaviour. Through playing games and engaging in discussions, students will understand the importance of living a healthy lifestyle;

7/17/2025 3:36:54 PM


## 0_Prelims.indd 6

concepts of Physics and Biology ina playful manner, and how physical activity adds to their overall enjoyment and success. Students will also learn about the safety measures to minimise the risk of injuries and create a healthy environment for the students.

In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health.

Units 3, 4 and 5 focus on learning new games. Athletics is introduced in Unit 3, Table Tennis in Unit 4 and Volleyball in Unit 5. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sports and health advantages of physical activities. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement.

In the last unit, that is, Unit 6 students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogdsanas starting with Sukshma Vydyama (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each dsana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Pranayama strengthen the lungs, improve functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dharana (single pointed concentration) and Dhydna (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays the foundation for a long and healthy life.

In this book, apart from learning the games and physical activities, students will learn to follow rules, understand the importance of safe practices and fair play, work harmoniously in groups, treat each other with courtesy and respect, as well as, help each other, and experience the joy of playing together. Inculcation of these values and dispositions will partly happen while children are engaged in the physical activities or games and partly, they will be reinforced

during circle time after the game. Sufficient time must be given for circle time during the Physical Education and Well-being periods.


## Structure and Flow of Classes

Refer to the previous class’ textbook for suggestive session plan. As per NCF-SE 2023 recommendations 90 hours are allocated to physical education and well-being. So, 115-120 periods of 40 minutes each for activities and classes along with 15-20 periods for formative and summative assessment have been allocated. Principals and physical education teachers have the liberty to plan classes keeping in mind equal emphasis and distribution of all units. Since assessment depicting progression in the motor fitness, sport-specific skills, yoga and psychosocial domain, session-ending assessment procedure will remain the same as formative assessment. Suggestive timetable assumes at least 5 periods of 40 minute each, per week. NCF-SE recommends allocating block period (2 periods together) for physical education and well-being. If it is not possible to allocate two block periods and one single period every week, it is necessary to design single periods with different focus to ensure sufficient time for activities, game and circle time.

Suggestions are given below for two different scenarios of timetable. ¢ Scenario 1 - Five single periods per week. * Scenario 2 —- Two block periods for Units 1 to 5 and single period


## for yoga.

Scenario 1: Three different types of sessions have been visualised to effectively use the limited time in each period and achieve the learning outcomes.


## e Type i: Maximises game practice.

Type 2: Maximises circle time after play to provide sufficient time for discussing cognitive and socio-emotional aspects.

Type 3: Maximises gamified drills to focus on one specific skill.

A sample time allocation for a 40-minute duration is given below for all types.

of competencies, teachers may follow the instructions given below:

Ensure adequate play area and that there are no obstructions in the play area.

For group activities, mark the area into smaller blocks to prevent students from running into each other.

While dividing the teams, make sure that the divison is fair and balanced in terms of bodyweight, height and skills required for the activity.

Ensure that a first aid kit is available and accessible.

Ensure that students are treated with respect and they feel emotionally and socially safe.


## Provide regular encouragement and support to all the students.

Ensure students have access to fair redressal of grievances during the Physical Education period.

Encourage students to be aware of their surroundings while playing.

Instruct the students not to aim at the opponent.

Encourage the students to be careful while pushing or pulling the opponent in the activity.

Ensure that students do proper warm-up and cool-down exercises. Encourage them to create their own routines.


## Provide opportunities to students for interactions before, during and after the class.

7/17/2025 3:36:55 PM


## 0_Prelims.indd 10

Introduce sports skills gradually. Complexity can be increased by playing mini versions of the sport gradually building individual capacities such as, observation, reflection, emotional regulation, expanding spatial awareness and peripheral vision, and making quick judgements based on gameplay.

Discuss social capacities such as, effective communication, collective decision making, and working together towards a common goal, during circle time and at relevant moments in the sport.

Discuss the concepts of Physics such as, conduction, motion,


## etc. and concepts of Biology such as breathing, muscles, neuro


## muscular coordination, muscle adaptation in a playful manner through physical activities.

Encourage students to take more responsibility for building a

culture of inclusive sports at school. Help them to play an active

role in ensuring all students feel safe, motivated, and encouraged

to play.

1. Sideways Hopping

Jump from side to side over a line or a cone with both feet together engaging the core and lower body. This will enhance explosive strength and neuromuscular co-ordination.


## Lateral Shuffle

Lateral shuffle is a fast footwork drill done on an agility ladder. Step in with one foot, then the other, and step out laterally, repeati a shuffle pattern.

This improves coordination, speed, and sense of rhythm.

3. Skiers

With feet together, jump from side to side as if skiing, keeping knees slightly

bent. This targets lower body explosiveness and cardiovascular endurance.

7/16/2025 5:15:21 PM

4. High Knee Jump with Object

Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Hold a small object in front of the chest using both hands as shown in the figure. Begin performing high knees, lifting each knee toward the chest. Aim to tap both knees to the object alternatively. This engages the core muscles. Avoid leaning back or swinging the torso.

5. Seated Ball Toss with Partner

Start with both partners seated facing each other with their

knees bent in front. The first _ partner holds a ball with both hands and tosses it over to the second partner. The second partner catches the ball and

throws it back to the first partner. They perform alternate tosses.

6. Progressive Vertical Reach Jumps

Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart, arms relaxed and knees bent with hips in a mid-squat position.

as high as possible. Land softly on the toes and immediately

perform the next jump. This helps in


## the development of explosive strength.

## Neck Exercise with a Cloth

Use a cloth for gentle resistance around the head and perform slow neck movements in various directions. This strengthens the neck muscles.


## Resistive Wrist Exercises

Use a band or an object to perform wrist flexion and extensions along with radial or ulna deviation against resistance (as shown in the figure). This helps to develop forearm and wrist strength.


## Perturbation

This is a partner activity in which a Partner B will stand behind a Partner A, as shown in the figure. Partner B will apply an external force such as a gentle push (a rough push may result in injury) in all the directions, in a step-by- step manner. Partner A will try to hold their position. This enhances proprioception (sense of joint), neuromuscular control and balance.

## Athletics

c b Athletics is one of the oldest and most basic forms of sport. It is also

known as Track and Field and the events of athletics are classified as

Track Events, Field Events, and Combined Events. The fundamental skills of

athletics are divided into different categories, including running, jumping,

and throwing events. Athletics is a multi-physical skill training discipline

that emphasises improving physical traits like strength, speed, endurance,

agility, flexibility, and coordination. It comprises a wide range of events, including long-distance running, jumping, throwing, and sprinting.

Athletics have a positive impact on human development throughout the physical training phase of education. The appropriate operation and physical development of the human body is assured by carefully chosen activities and their application in all age groups and physical education fields. Running, jumping, throwing, and walking all contribute to

the growth and development of the physiological system as well as fundamental physical and technical skills.

4 Wan sind 57) 7/17/2025 3:40:18 PM


## 04_Unit 3.indd 58

Furthermore, athletics is a way to develop character and willpower during training and competition. Physical education teachers may assist in development characteristics like willpower, determination, resoluteness, self-discipline, team spirit, and awareness to succeed by observing how athletes behave throughout practice and competition.


## Running

Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion by which humans and other animals move quickly on foot. Running is an aerial gait in which the feet are above the ground. Running is one of the most essential athletic skills, requiring proper technique, speed, endurance, and coordination.


## TECHNIQUES TO START THE RACE

There are two types of starts:

1. Crouch start or Sitting start: This is used for all running events up to 400-metre. It allows the runner to react to the sound and start the race as fast as possible by properly positioning their centre of gravity in the ‘set’ position. In a short-distance race, the outcome is decided by a quick start and an increased acceleration capacity. Modern starting techniques use three different types of starting positions, which are outlined below:

(a) Bunch or Bullet start (b) Medium start (c) Elongated start

2. Standing start: This type of start is commonly used in middle- distance and long-distance races. The athlete begins in an upright position, with one foot slightly ahead of the other, and starts running smoothly when the race begins. This start allows for better pacing and control over longer distances. In this Grade you will only learn about Crouch or Sitting Start.

## “On your “Set” < Drive >< marks”

1. ON YouR MARKS POSITION

¢ On the command “On your marks”, the runners assume the position for the crouch start.

¢ They take a position directly in front of the starting blocks.

¢ The foot of the stronger leg is placed on the front block and the foot of the other leg on the rear block.

¢ Care should be taken that only the tip of the foot touches the ground and that the rear foot is pressed firmly against the block.

¢ The knee of the rear leg is now placed on the ground. Both hands (shoulder width apart) contact the ground with the thumbs.

e The thumb and the index finger are spread so that they form a high bridge.

¢ Head carriage is relaxed, and the eyes are focused on a point on the ground.


## Teachers should

e Ensure that the blocks are appropriately set up for the runner.

e Observe the runner’s posture including the head position.

e Check that the hand position is comfortable and correctly placed.


## Khel Yatra

## 04_Unit 3.indd 60


## Acceleration >

2. SET POSITION

e At “set”, the runners raise their hips by lifting the knee of the rear leg off the ground.

¢ The body weight is distributed almost evenly over the four supporting areas.

¢ The head remains in a natural, relaxed position.

¢ The ‘set’ position conveys to the runner’s body the preliminary tension necessary for a powerful start from the blocks.

¢ Inorder to achieve a high initial speed, the angles of both legs are of particular importance. An angle of about 90° at the front knee and of about 110° to 130° at the rear knee is appropriate.

Teachers should ¢ Observe from the front and side.


## ¢ Observe the position of the trunk and the limbs.

¢« Ensure that runners are stable.

¢ Confirm that the runner’s focus is on sprinting from the blocks.


## Fundamental Skills of Sports — Athletics

7/17/2025 3:40:20 PM


## DRIVE PHASE

At “go”, the sprinter starts without any delay. A quick response to the gun is of major importance for a fast start.

The power exerted on the blocks when starting will transmit the highest possible initial velocity to the runner’s body.

This is brought about by an explosive pushing of both


## legs against the blocks.

The main technical skills in the leg action are:

— After coming off the rear starting block, the push-off leg starts to drive forward, that is, the thigh is rapidly drawn forward and upward.

— The leading leg should remain in an approximately horizontal position.


## Proper arm action:

— The arms have an important function in helping to produce the starting acceleration.


## — Pay special attention to the action of the arms.

— The movement of the swinging leg requires that the respective arm swings forward and upward.

— The arm tends to bend increasingly at the elbow until it reaches an angle of about 90° in the final phase of the movement.


## 04_Unit 3.indd 62


## Khel Yatra


## Teachers should

¢ Observe the speed of reaction to the gun and the sequence of movement.

e Observe the speed and extension of the knee and hip joints. e Ensure that the athlete optimises the drive from the blocks.

¢ Observe that the arms move quickly so that there is a coordinated leg balance.

— Inthis process, at the first swing towards the forehead, the elbow has a slight outward spread.

— The opposite arm performs a corresponding counter- movement backwards.

4. ACCELERATION PHASE

e At the beginning of the acceleration phase, the runner has a marked forward body lean.

e With an increasing rate and length of stride, the angle of inclination gradually decreases, so that after 20m the runner reaches the normal sprinting position.

¢ The forward body lean should be at its maximum when the front foot comes off the starting block and during the initial strides.

¢ A good body lean is a function of the power exerted by the push-off force during the first few strides.

¢ The greater this force, the smaller the angle between the runner’s body and the ground.

e Runners with a poor push-off force will come to an upright position sooner.

In some cases, runners with a good push-off force prematurely assume an upright position because they raise their heads immediately after the start in order to look up to the finish.


## Fundamental Skills of Sports — Athletics

7/17/2025 3:40:20 PM

Upon the command “on your marks”. The body weight is either distributed over both legs or is already over the front leg.

Upon the command “set”, the flexion of the front knee is in most cases increased and in all runners, the body weight is now over the front leg.

The upper body is bent forward.

If the time lag between the commands “set” and “go” is long, it will result in the danger of a false start due to a further forward shift of the body’s centre of gravity.


## 04_Unit 3.indd 64


## Teachers should

Observe the action of the limbs and position of the trunk and head.


## Observe the increase in stride length and frequency.

64

Ensure that the runner’s transition into the sprinting action is smooth.


## FINISH PHASE

The runner maintains top speed through the finish line.

The runner leans forward slightly to break the finish line faster.


## Khel Yatra

e The runner uses proper arm drive and stride control to sustain momentum. ¢ The runner avoids decelerating too soon to ensure the best possible time. ¢ The following techniques can be used to attain optimal finishing position - Run Through: This technique involves maintaining full speed beyond the finish line to ensure the best possible race time.

— Lunge: In a close race, an athlete may extend one leg forward and lean their upper body towards the finish line to break the tape first.

— Shoulder Shrug: Moving one shoulder forward at the finish line can help an athlete gain an advantage in a very close race by crossing the line first.

## Jumping

Jumping is an essential skill in athletics, defined as the act of propelling oneself into the air using one or both legs. It requires power, coordination, and technique. From a technical perspective, jumping events vary in complexity, ranging from the simple Long Jump to the High Jump and Triple Jump, with the Pole Vault appearing more intricate. The primary objective in these events is to achieve the greatest possible height or distance. In the Triple Jump, athletes aim to maximise the total distance of three successive jumps, while in the Pole Vault, they utilise a pole to assist in clearing greater heights. The key components of jumping are:

1. Approach run ¢« Acontrolled run to generate momentum. e Athletes must maintain speed and balance before take- off. 2. Take-off ¢ The athlete pushes off from the ground using one or both legs. e Proper body alignment is essential for maximising height and distance. 3. Flight phase ¢ The body remains in motion after take-off. e Proper posture and leg movement are crucial to maintaining balance. 4. Landing e Athletes should land with bent knees to absorb impact. ¢ Athletes should maintain a balanced position to avoid fouls.

## Long Jump Strategy

The long jump is divided into the following phases- approach, take-off, flight, and landing. 1. APPROACH PHASE e Approach length varies from 10 strides for beginners to over 20 strides for elite jumpers. e The running technique is similar to sprinting, with speed gradually increasing until take-off. e The jumper accelerates to its maximum controllable speed.

¢ Maintaining a consistent stride pattern is crucial for an optimal take-off position.

## Flight >< Landing

3. FLIGHT PHASE

The jumper prepares for landing while maintaining balance and control in the air.

Three different techniques can be used: Sail, Hang, and Hitch-Kick.

In this, players will be learning only Sail and Hang.

Sail: The simplest technique, where the jumper extends their legs forward.

1. 2. 3. 4

5.

The free leg is maintained in the take-off position. The trunk stays upright and vertical. The take-off leg trails for most of the flight.

Near the end of the flight, the take-off leg bends and moves forwards and upwards.

Both legs extend forward for landing.

Hang: The jumper stretches arms and legs backwards before bringing them forward.

1.

2. 3. 4

The free leg lowers through hip joint rotation. The hips are pushed forward.

The take-off leg aligns parallel to the free leg. The arms are positioned upward and backward.


## Fundamental Skills of Sports — Athletics

4. LANDING PHASE

¢ The legs are nearly fully extended.

¢ The trunk leans forward.

¢ The arms are pulled backward.

The hips are pushed forward towards the touchdown point.

¢ The jumper strives to maximise the distance of the flight path.

e Landing with the feet first while avoiding backward movement prevents distance loss.

¢ Proper body positioning minimises impact and enables a smooth transition after landing.

An obstacle course is set up around a square area, with a designated group of Hunters whose goal is to capture other athletes.

Captured athletes must complete a lap of the obstacle course before re-entering the square.

The aim of the Hunters is to remove all athletes from the square simultaneously to win.

If at least one athlete remains in the square by the end of all rounds, the non-Hunters win.

The game is played in limited rounds to prevent fatigue. Anew team of Hunters is assigned at the start of each round to ensure fairness and rotation.

## FLIGHT PHASE

The jumper uses one of the two main techniques: Straddle or Fosbury Flop.

We will discuss only Straddle in this class: Straddle Technique 1. The jumper clears the bar facing downwards.

2. The take-off leg extends first over the bar, followed by the trailing leg.


## Khel Yatra

3. The body remains parallel to the bar with the head and shoulders leading the clearance. 4. LANDING PHASE ¢ The jumper's head is drawn towards the chest. ¢ Landing is on the shoulders and back. e Knees are apart for touch down.


## Lead-up Activity

Each pair stands in front of a soft high-jump bar. One partner gently throws a small ball above the bar, and the other must jump, clear the bar, and catch the ball before it lands. Partners switch roles after each attempt. The pair with the most successful catches wins.

G (5 In this unit, we will learn about the game of table tennis, one

of the fastest racquet game in the world. Played on a wooden table with a dark, matte surface divided by a net, this fast-paced sport uses a 40+mm ball and a racquet of any shape or size. Players use a combination of forehand and backhand strokes, applying both defensive and attacking techniques to win rallies and score points. It requires quick reflexes, as well as eye-hand and sound coordination. Fast movements, accuracy, concentration along with attention attracts people of all ages and genders to this game. Earlier known as Ping-Pong and Gossima, table tennis is a recreational, remedial and competitive sport.

To understand table tennis better we will learn about speed, strength, quick reaction time and its combination, as well as physical, mental,

social, emotional and spiritual skills which enable players to play, sustain, and live a holistic life.

¢ Thumb and index finger should hold the actual handle near the blade.

¢ The remaining fingers are positioned around the back of the racquet blade.

Note: There are two types of Penhold Grip; Chinese Grip and Japnese Grip but nowadays, the Shakehand Grip is more commonly used worldwide.

Footwork is one of the most important aspects of table tennis, in order to return a ball at marked 1.525 m wide endline and its imaginary extention on both sides. The key principle of an efficient return is returning the ball in front of the body’s medial line in the backhand grip and comfortable lateral movement in the forehand grip. Also, a quick and proper placement of the foot, sideways, backwards and forwards with a balanced weight, is necessary while returning to make it comfortable. Footwork helps players move efficiently to position themselves for the best possible execution of skills. Proper footwork allows for quick reactions, better balance, and smoother transitions between strokes.

Lead-up Activity | Players will participate in pairs. Each player takes turns serving with a topspin motion, aiming to land the ball on the opponent’s side consistently. If a service bounces twice or forces the opponent into a weak return, then the service is considered successful, and the player earns one point. If the serve goes out or into the net, the service is unsuccessful, and the opponent earns the point. The first player to reach five points wins the round, while the loser switches to challenge a different opponent.

To increase the difficulty, the ‘target accuracy challenge’ can be introduced, where specific areas on the table are marked, and players earn extra points for landing their service in those zones. Another variation is the ‘spin challenge’, where players must apply more spin with each service, making it harder for their opponent to return the ball.


## Notes for the teacher

¢ The teachers should first demonstrate the correct topspin service technique, highlighting grip, body position, and the brushing motion needed to generate spin. Player should practice the service against a wall or with partners, receiving individual feedback on their form.

A Backspin Service in table tennis is a defensive serve that makes the ball spin backwards, causing it to slow down after

bouncing and making it harder for the opponent to attack. Oe


## Warm-up Cool-down : Circle time


## Reflection and strategy |


## Backspin Service

The Backspin Service comprises the following:

1. STANCE ¢ The ball shall be resting on an open and stationary palm. ¢ Keep the racquet and free hand above and behind the end line of the table.

7/16/2025 5:23:06 PM


## eo 2. BACKSWING

¢ Toss the ball at least 16 cm (6 inch) vertically. ¢ Move the racquet backwards behind the ball. ¢ Open the racquet angle for the backspin service.

i) 3. STRIKE * Swing the racquet forwards. ¢ Make contact with the ball squarely.

Strike the bottom of the ball to create backspin.

4. FOLLOW-THROUGH

¢ Follow through forwards and go deep downwards for the backspin. ¢ Get ready to recover to return the next ball.


## Lead-up Activity

Players will participate in pairs. Each player takes turns serving with the backspin motion, aiming to land the ball on the opponent’s side successfully. If the service is executed correctly by the player, and it forces the opponent into a weak return or a mistake, the player earns one point. If the service goes into the net or off the table, it is considered unsuccessful, then the opponent earns the point. The first player to reach five points wins the round, while the loser switches to face a new opponent.


## Fundamental Skills of Sports — Table Tennis

7/16/2025 5:23:06 PM

To increase the difficulty level, a ‘spin effect challenge’ can be introduced. The players must serve the ball in such a way that after it bounces or touches the opponent’s court, it returns back to the net due to the heavy backspin. The more the ball spins backwards, the better the service. Another variation is the ‘target zone challenge’, in which players aim to land their backspin service in specific marked areas on the table for extra points.

~) | Notes for the teacher The teachers should first demonstrate the correct backspin

yj 2 service technique, highlighting grip, ball contact, and follow- ct y through. > = Players should start with slow, controlled serves, focusing on proper spin before increasing speed and variation. The teachers should give individual feedback and emphasise consistency over speed, spin and power.

To increase the difficulty level, different variations can be introduced. In the ‘target challenge’, specific zones on the opponent’s side of the table are marked, and players earn an extra point if they land their drive in those areas. In the timed rally, the goal is to maintain the longest backhand drive rally without making an error, and the player achieving the longest streak is declared the winner. For a more competitive round, a knockout game can be added in which any player who loses three rallies in a row must perform a quick exercise, such as five jumping jacks, before rejoining the game.

b G Volleyball is a fast-paced, exciting team sport played by two

teams on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is

to score points by sending the ball over the net in a way that it lands

on the opponent's court. Each team consists of six players on the court

at a time, with specialised roles such as spikers, setters, blockers, and liberos.

Each team has up to three touches to return the ball over the net and the block touch is not counted. In this unit, we will experience and learn basic skills like serving, passing, setting, spiking, blocking and digging.

## Basic moves and strategies

The Underhand Pass in volleyball, also known as a bump pass, dig pass or simple pass, is a fundamental skill used to receive and control the ball, typically after a serve or an attacking hit (smash or spike) from the opposing team.

1. GRIP AND HAND POSITION

¢ Bring the hands together by overlapping one hand over the other and creating a semi-closed fist with one hand and covering it with the other. Ensure the thumbs are parallel, pointing forward and slightly down as shown in the figure. Lock-in the elbows (should not bend), extend the arms in front and bend the wrist downwards.

2. STANCE * Keep the feet shoulder-width apart and diagonally to each other.

06_Unit 5.indd 136 7/16/2025 5:20:08 PM

¢ Bend the knees slightly, straighten the spine and lean slightly forward.

¢ Keep the arms relaxed, below the chest yet ready in front of you.

¢ Maintain a low stance as it gives better control and balance.

¢ Bring the hands together by creating a semi-closed fist with one hand and overlapping it over the other as shown in the figure. Ensure that the thumbs are parallel, pointing forward and slightly downwards.

Lock the elbows (should not bend), extend the arms in front and bend the wrist downwards.

3. EXECUTION ¢ Try to put your body in the centre of the falling ball’s path. ¢ Let the forearms make contact with the ball with straight and locked elbows, and upwards swinging arms. Make use of your flexed knees by extending the lower limbs while hitting the ball.

¢ To direct the ball higher, extend your bent knees and push the forearm with high impact.

Move to position Contact point Extend to target

7/16/2025 5:20:08 PM

3. FOLLOW-THROUGH

¢ Maintain a stable arm stance and once the ball makes contact, follow through in the desired direction of its trajectory.

e« Avoid excessive arm motion, since it can interfere with pass accuracy and the opponent may return the ball at any moment of time.

e Make two teams and ask them to form a circle. On the blow of the whistle, both the teams will start passing the ball with an underhand pass, making sure that the ball doesn’t fall.

e Ifthe ball falls, it will be picked up again and the rally will restart.

Spiking a volleyball entails forcefully striking the ball over the net towards the floor of the opponent’s court. 1. STANCE

e Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart for balance. Position yourself under or slightly behind the ball.

¢ Raise the dominant arm, with its elbow bent, slightly behind the head. This results in a powerful angle for the spike. ¢ Monitor the ball continuously to anticipate its fall. ¢ Maintain constant focus on the ball, especially as it approaches the spiking zone. 2. EXECUTION

¢ Extend the non-dominant hand upwards while tilting the torso inline in the falling ball’s path.

¢ Bring the dominant arm down forcefully, making contact with the ball at its highest point.

06_Unit 5.indd 150 7/16/2025 5:20:17 PM

¢ Aim to spike the ball with your palm.

¢ To create a spin and a sharp downwards trajectory, spike the ball at the centre or top centre, then lead it downwards with a snapping motion of the wrist.

¢ While swinging the arm, rotate the torso slightly to generate more power from the core. The power for the spike is generated by the movement of the upper extremities, torso, pelvic and the lower extremities.

¢ Right-handed players step with their left foot first, then their right foot, and finally their left foot for balance and power. Left-handed players reverse the sequence.


## FOLLOW-THROUGH

e After making contact, the motion continues with the arm moving downwards and forward. As the movement finishes, the wrist snaps to direct the ball to the opposite side of the court.

) Aim to use the whole body to serve: The role of potential and

kinetic energy. To generate a powerful and effective serve, it is important to use the whole body, applying both types of energy.

7

Potential Energy is stored in the body when a player bends their knees, loads their arm, and prepares to serve. This energy builds up before the movement. Kinetic Energy is released when the player extends their legs, swings their arm, and makes contact with the ball, converting stored energy into motion for a strong serve.

Spiking is also known as smash which can be done from any place of the court but smashing near the net helps more in scoring a point.

Extremities refer to the limbs of the body.

e Upper Extremities: These include the arms, from the shoulder to the hands.

¢ Lower Extremities: These include the legs, from the hip to the toes.

While performing any activity, spatial attributes describe movement such as distance, while temporal attributes relate to time.

## Anticipate

Blocking is a skill which is performed close to the net to intercept the ball spiked from the opponent. It is a defensive move in which defenders try to stop or deflect the ball back to the opponent’s side. A block can be executed either solo or with another blocker.

1. STANCE

¢ Standing near the net, with the knees slightly bent and the arms raised, the blocker will be on their toes and ready to move in any direction.

2. EXECUTION e Extend the hands over the net to face the opponent, the blocker will rise and reach the ball just in front of the spiker in order to block the ball over the net. * To direct the ball to the opposing team’s court, keep the fingers spread and angle the hands downwards.

06_Unit 5.indd 155 7/16/2025 5:20:23 PM

3. FOLLOW-THROUGH (LANDING)

Tominimise the body’s impact at the time of the landing, keep the knees bent so that the feet absorb the impact and prepare the body for the next move.

Lead-up Activity Make multiple players stand in a queue across the net. Every pair will be given a duration of 30 seconds in which they have to jump together and clap each other’s palms above the net. At the same time, they have to keep on moving towards the far-side sideline. After 30 seconds, there will be another blow of the whistle and then the blocker has to stop. Now, new pair will start doing the same. While clapping each other’s hands, if a player touches the net, the clap will not be counted. The pair with the maximum number of claps will be the winner.

## Concentration |

Dig is a defensive skill used to prevent the ball from touching the ground after an opponent’s spike or drop near the net. It involves using the forearms or hands to control and redirect the ball upwards, allowing the team to continue the play.

1. STANCE ¢ Keep the feet shoulder-width apart, knees bent, and body low.

¢ Weight should be balanced on the balls of the feet for quick movement.

¢ The arms must be extended and the hands must be kept together, forming a strong platform.

¢ Diggers must bend their knees to stay low towards the ground and position their hands in front for quick reactions.

2. EXECUTION ¢ Move quickly to get under the ball. ¢ Keep your arms straight and use the forearm to absorb the impact.

06_Unit 5.indd 157 7/16/2025 5:20:24 PM

e Angle the forearm to direct the ball towards the setter. * Use Both Hands: Whenever possible, a dig should be performed with both hands together, forming a contact point to control the ball’s direction and prevent it from going out of bounds. e Avoid Swinging the Arms: Instead of swinging, absorb the ball’s impact using the legs and a firm forearm.

3. FOLLOW-THROUGH * Maintain control and balance after contact. ¢ Incase ofa dive, roll the body to neutralise the impact.


## Lead-up Activity ¥

A feeder stands four feet ahead of a digger, holding one soft sponge ball in each hand. The digger starts in a squat position with hands joined in a ready stance. The feeder randomly drops one of the balls, and the digger must react quickly to reach, get below the ball, and catch it before it hits the ground. Each digger gets 10 attempts, and the player with the most successful catches is the winner of the drill.

## About Yoga

Yoga is more than just stretching and bending; it is an ancient science that guides us towards a harmonious life. It teaches us how to cultivate a natural balance among the body, mind and emotions. This inner harmony is inspired by nature’s perfect balance, just as it harmonises day and night or the changing seasons. The Bhagavad Gita defines yoga as “samatvam yoga uchyate (2.48)”, meaning “Yoga is a state of balance.”

The key to achieving this state is to focus on the present moment, and enjoying what is happening right now rather than dwelling on the past or anticipating the future. This practice naturally reduces stress and brings freedom from desires. Furthermore, it helps us mindfully connect with the world while teaching us to be kind, compassionate, and understanding towards others’ feelings. Let us now turn our attention to the yoga practices that further deepen our connection to the present moment.

Do you remember those amazing yoga poses we learnt in Grade 7, like the graceful Marjaridsana and the energising Surya Namaskara? We explored the concept of Pancha Kosha to gain a deeper understanding of the different layers of the self. We even mastered some challenging poses like the Utakatasana, Sarvagasana, Danurdsana, and the Matsydsana. We also learnt to regulate our breath with Bhastrika Pranayama and discovered the benefits of Hasta Mudra. Now, let us continue this fascinating journey by deepening our understanding, and learning a few more practices.

In this grade, we will explore how yoga can support us, particularly as we navigate changes and learn to manage our emotions. We will explore Yama and Niyama and learn how to apply them in our daily lives. We will also learn Sukshma Vyayama, Sthula Vyayama, Surya Namaskara, dsana


## Khel Yatra

(yoga postures), relaxation techniques, Hasta Mudrdas (hand gestures), Satkarma (cleansing practices), Pranayama (breathing exercises), Pratyahara (learning to control our senses), Dharana (focusing our minds), Dhydna (meditation), and Krida Yoga (yoga games). These practices will help us concentrate, manage distractions, and find inner peace in the present moment.

eS A . Chapter 1 forDailyLife

Yoga, with its rich and vast history, has been practised for

thousands of years. Over time, various masters documented

their techniques and experiences in ancient yoga texts. These texts are more than just books; they are treasure chests holding the profound wisdom of yoga masters. This wisdom passed down through generations, illuminates the path of yoga, offering guidance on ethical living, physical postures, breath regulation, and mental discipline.

Some of the most important yoga texts are as follows:

Patafijali Yoga Sutra: Maharishi Patafijali’s Yoga Sutra is the initial systematic text of yoga sadhana. It has four pada (chapters), and contains 195 short, concise, and powerful statements that guide us on the path of yoga. These sutras teach us various important concepts, such as Ashtanga Yoga. Hatha Pradipika: This text discusses the practical aspects of yoga and is divided into 4 chapters. Swami Svatmarama is the author of this text. It explains how to practise dsanas, Shatkarma (six cleansing techniques), Pranayama, mudra, Bandha (neuromuscular or energy locks—muscle contractions that facilitate energy flow) and Samadhi. Gheranda Samhita: The Gheranda Samhita, written by Rishi Gheranda, is a practical guide to yoga comprising seven chapters. It teaches Saptanga Yoga, a step-by-step method that begins with body exercises and leads to inner understanding. It talks about Shatkarma, dsana, mudra, Pratyahara, Pranayama, Dhyana and Samadhi.

7/16/2025 5:24:08 PM

07_Unit 6.indd_ 172

The Bhagvad Gita, an ancient scripture, shares deep wisdom about Yoga, with Shri Krishna guiding Arjuna through various paths of yoga across 18 chapters. Similarly, the Yoga Vasistha, a revered text, features Sage VaSistha illuminating Shri Rama on yogic principles for understanding life and finding inner peace. Both these texts, along with Maharishi Patafijali's structured Yoga Sutras and the practical guidance found in the Hatha Pradipika and Gheranda Samhita, offer valuable insights into the core ideas and teachings of yoga from different periods of ancient Indian history. These texts emphasise that yoga is much more than just physical postures; it is a holistic way of living. By understanding and applying their teachings, we can enhance our physical and mental well-being, learn to live with integrity and mindfulness, become better individuals, and contribute positively to society.

## YAMA AND NIYAMA Yama

As we all know, Ashtanga Yoga consists of eight limbs, the first of which is Yama. Yamas are universal guidelines for being good that everyone, everywhere, at any time, should try to follow, regardless of their religion or region. Yama’s principles help us become good citizens who care for others. Patafijali's Yoga Sutras explain these disciplines as follows:


## er ceee

Yama consists of five principles: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (moderation), and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness).

By practising these Yamas, we can create a peaceful and harmonious society where everyone feels valued and respected.


## ee eee, © LE


## Understanding the Yamas

1. Choose any one Yama, and explain it in your own words with the help of an example. How would you practice it in your day-to-day life? You can also draw a simple picture to illustrate it.

2. Discuss in the group how the Yamas can help us become responsible citizens.

Now, create one situation related to the above yamas.

Notes for the teacher « Encourage students to relate the yamas to their experiences.

¢ Facilitate a class discussion following the activity, allowing students to share their answers and perspectives.

« Emphasise that even small actions can make a difference.

Now, let us explore yogic concepts for cultivating ourselves into better individuals.


## Niyama

Through Yamas, we learn to interact with the world in a kind and honest manner. Niyamas help us focus on our inner self. Maharishi Patafijali provides us with five Niyamas, personal guidelines that help us lead a joyful and fulfilling life.

The five Niyamas are Shaucha (cleanliness), Santosha (contentment), Tapas (self-discipline), Svadhyaya (self-study), and Ishvara Pranidhana (surrender to the divine). Niyama teaches us to look within, rather than focusing solely on what is happening around us.

1. Shaucha (Cleanliness): Shaucha means physical and mental purity. We can practise it by keeping the body clean, eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. For mental purity, we can chant the mantras (japa), perform selfless service, and cultivate cheerfulness and compassion for others.

7/16/2025 5:24:09 PM


## 07_Unit 6.indd 176

Santosha (Contentment): Santosha means finding joy and peace. It teaches us that true happiness is not just about having more things, but instead, it is about appreciating what you already have in your life. When we practice Santosha, we feel calm and at ease. We can also cultivate a deeper sense of contentment by appreciating the good in others, being kind to everyone, finding joy in giving, and learning to forgive. This does not mean we ignore our potential to grow, instead, it is about truly enjoying what we have, even with its limitations, much like a child who finds pure happiness in small, simple things.

Tapas (Self-discipline): Tapas means _ self-discipline, dedication, and determination. Cultivating tapas empowers us with the inner strength to pursue our goals and navigate life’s challenges diligently. It is the willpower that enables us to remain disciplined in our actions, stay consistent in our efforts, and even willingly set aside immediate comforts for the sake of achieving a larger objective.

Svadhyaya (Self-study): Svadhyadya means self-study, which helps us develop self-discipline. We can understand ourselves better through activities like reading, meditation, and self-reflection. Even when we do any task with focus and effort, we learn more about ourselves. Additionally, gaining knowledge through books and experienced persons enriches your understanding and makes life easier and happier.

Ishvara Pranidhana (Surrender to the divine): [shvara Pranidhana means completely surrendering to a higher power. By regularly engaging in self-study, we grow in self-awareness, which in turn can lead us to develop a deep trust in this higher power. We can nurture this profound devotion by practising bhakti such as through prayer and by reading inspiring devotional texts. This dedicated practice

has the power to transform our entire being, preparing us to understand and live a life of higher purpose.

Let us understand and apply the five Niyamas in our daily lives. For each

Niyamas explain how it helps you live a better life by using the questions


## below as a guide.

1. Choose just one of the five Niyamas that you want to focus on for a short while.

2. Instead of a big goal, think of one small, simple wish related to that Niyama. If you choose ‘being more organised’, your small wish could be ‘I want to feel happy with whatever I already have.’

3. How will you know if you are making your small wish come true?

4. Is your small wish something you can really do?

5. Why would making this small wish come true be a good thing for you? 6. How long do you hope to make this small wish happen?

## Shaucha: Physical and-‘mental purity

Let us learn more about Shaucha. Shaucha refers not only to the physical cleanliness of the body but also to the mental purity of the mind. To maintain mental purity or health, let us explore and understand the Arisadvargas, which are like enemies of the mind.

The Arishadvargas are six negative forces that can disturb our minds. They are:

Desire Anger Greed Attachment | Arrogance Jealousy (Kama) (Krodha) (Lobha) (Moha) (Mada) (Matsarya)

Think of your mind as a calm, clear pond. Shaucha means keeping this mental pond clean and free from any dirt. When the pond is clear, you can see everything within it beautifully. But if it gets dirty, everything becomes blurry and hard to see.


## Yoga

7/16/2025 5:24:09 PM

Let us read a story to gain a deeper understanding of how to keep our mental pond pure and clear.


## The story of Anjali and the clear pond

Anjali, a young teenager, often found solace in observing the village pond. Its usual state of pristine clarity, mirroring the expansive sky, evoked a sense of tranquillity and joy within her. The pond’s transparency allowed her to witness the vibrant life beneath the surface, where she observed the fish in their natural habitat. However, the pond’s condition was not always peaceful. Following turbulent weather or instances of pollution, the water would become murky and disturbed. This transformation saddened Anjali, as the loss of the clear reflection obscured the pond’s beauty, concealed its inhabitants, and created an overall sense of disorder.

One day, Anjali’s grandmother used the pond as an example to explain the nature of the human mind. She explained that when our thoughts are pure and untainted— Shaucha— we


## Khel Yatra

178

experience a state of mental clarity and emotional well-being, much like the pond in its clear state. We can perceive situations and emotions with accuracy and achieve inner peace. However, negative emotions, such as envy, anger, greed, attachment, and sadness, act like pollutants, clouding our minds and distorting our perceptions.

Anjali understood the analogy and began to apply the principle of purity, or Shaucha, to her mental state. When she experienced feelings of superiority or a desire to be the best, she reminded herself of the unique strengths and talents inherent in every individual. When confronted with anger towards her brother, she practised mindful breathing and sought to understand his perspective. She discovered that by maintaining a clear and uncluttered mind, she was able to experience greater peace, improved focus, and healthier relationships. She recognised that cultivating inner purity was essential for a fulfilling and balanced life.

1. Look at the messy thought bubble and clear thought bubble and write your messy thoughts in the speech bubble in simple words. For example, “I want more toys”, “Wanting too much, getting angry easily, feeling jealous.”

2. Inthe clear thought bubble write down the clear thought or the way you want to deal with the messy thoughts in simple words. For example, “It is okay to want things, but I have what I need.” “Remind yourself to be grateful for what you have, take three deep breaths before reacting, focus on enjoying what you have right now, congratulate your friend genuinely and focus on your own strengths.”


## Clear thoughts

3. Draw lines connecting each ‘messy thought’ bubble to a ‘clear thought’ bubble that could help deal with it.

4. Ifyour mind feels like a garden with messy weeds, what is one small thing you can do today to start taking care of it?

Just as Anjalilearned to keep her mental pond clear, the Yama and Niyama principles guide us in living a clean and pure life, both in our actions and thoughts. By following these guidelines, we can keep the ‘waters’ of our minds calm and clear, leading to inner peace and a better understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

Sadhana,

Just like learning to play music requires time and regular practice, yoga also demands strong willpower and consistent effort. This steady, long-term practice in yoga is known as Abhyasa. Abhyasa means practising regularly without giving up or getting distracted and doing so with respect. By engaging in Abhyasa, we can develop the right mindset and a strong foundation for our yoga journey.

When yoga is practised consistently, it enables us to apply the right kind of effort, focus, and energy and work efficiently towards achieving our goals. This mindset can help us succeed in various areas of life, such as studies, art, sports, and more.

## STHULA VYAYAMA

In the previous grade, we learnt about spinal flexibility. In this grade, let us explore Sthila vyayama and improve our physical stamina.

Sthula vyayama refers to a set of yogic exercises involving more vigorous movements than simple stretches. These exercises help improve overall physical fitness, strength, and flexibility. Often called ‘loosening exercises’, Sthila vyayama typically involves repetitive movements that prepare the body for more advanced yoga practices or other physical activities. Think of them as a way to warm up the body and prepare it for


## more intense activity. Pp

1. Rekha gati (line walking)


## Come to a standing posture.

STEP 1: Stand with your left foot flat on the ground. Bring your right foot forward. Place the heel of your right foot so it gently touches the toes of your left foot.

STEP 2: Take twenty steps forward. With each step, make sure the heel of your front foot touches the toes of your back foot. Try to walk in a straight line as you take these steps.


## Relax in vishranti.


## 186 Khel Yatra


## 07_Unit 6.indd 186

2. Hriday-gati (yogic jogging)

Also known as the ‘Locomotive Exercise’, it is named so because

it resembles a moving train engine.


## Come to a standing posture.

STEP 1: Bend your arms at the elbows as if you are holding something up.

STEP 2: Run forward on your toes, taking twenty small steps. As you run, move your arms forward and backwards like the pistons of a train engine.

STEP 3: When your right leg moves forward, push your right arm forward and your left arm backwards. Do the opposite when your left leg moves forward. Your feet should flick back from your knees so they almost touch your buttocks as you run. Breathe in and out sharply and deeply through your nose. Take twenty steps forward.

Step 4: After taking twenty steps forward, immediately move backwards the same distance. Maintain the same arm and leg movements and continue the sharp breathing. When your arms move backwards, ensure your elbows do not go further back than your body.


## Relax in vishranti.

¢ This vyayama expands and strengthens the chest.

¢ It builds the muscles in the thighs and calves. * Itis ideal for those who enjoy running and other sports.

3. Urdhva-gati (Up movement)


## Come to a standing posture.

STEP 1: Place your feet about one foot apart. Bend one arm at the

7/16/2025 5:24:16 PM

elbow so that your forearm is straight out in front of you. STEP 2: Stretch your other arm straight up towards the sky. Keep the palms of both hands open and facing away from you, with the fingers of both hands together. STEP 3: Bend your left knee slightly as if you are about to take a step. At the same time, stretch your right arm further upwards. Then, straighten your left knee and bring your right arm back to its starting position. STEP 4: Now, bend your right knee slightly and stretch your left arm upwards. Straighten your right knee and bring your left arm back to its starting position. Breathe in as you stretch your arm up and bend your knee. Breathe out as you return to the starting posture. To begin with, repeat this entire sequence (left knee/right arm, then right knee/left arm) 20 times.


## Relax in vishranti.

¢ This vyayama is good for the arms and legs.

¢ It improves blood circulation throughout the body.


## Notes for the teacher

Encourage patience and help students understand that flexibility and strength develop over time with consistent practice.

Be prepared to offer modifications or simpler variations for those who find the exercises challenging.

Briefly explain the benefits of each exercise, linking them to physical (strength, flexibility, balance, circulation) and mental (concentration) well-being.

Encourage students to practise these exercises at home, paying close attention to proper form and instructions.

## Asana

Now that we have explored the importance of preparatory practices by loosening our joints, let us practise the Surya Namaskara and other asanas.


## SURYA NAMASKARA

In Grade 7, we learnt how Surya Namaskara, a sequence of 12 asanas, helps stretch, strengthen, and rejuvenate our body and mind. It's an excellent way to greet the sun and start the day on a positive note.

In Grade 8, we will explore the different names of the Sun and how chanting them during Surya Namaskara can instil positive qualities within us.

Each round of Surya Namaskara begins with the chanting of ‘Om’ followed by a specific name of the Sun. These names are a part of a mantra— sound combinations believed to positively influence our minds, making them more active, efficient, and healthy.

It is believed that chanting the Sun’s name while performing the Surya Namaskara helps us develop qualities like friendship, devotion, energy, health, strength, and vigour. By focusing on these positive qualities associated with the Sun, we connect with the divine and bring these virtues into our lives.

7/16/2025 5:24:17 PM.


## 07_Unit 6.indd 190


## Note

Ratha saptami, also known as surya saptami, is a special day to celebrate the Sun’s powerful energy and marks an important change in its path. To honour this, we can practice the beautiful flow of twelve yoga poses known as the Sirya Namaskara. On Ratha saptami, it is wonderful to perform these twelve postures twelve times, like a moving prayer to the Sun.

Starting prayer for the practice Adopt the Namaskara Mudra and chant the prayer: froma on aerated Tar Area THATTAT AATAT FEA| Hiranmayena Patrena Satyasydapihitam Mukham |


## Tat Tvam Pishannapavrinu Satyadharmaya Drishtaye II


## Meaning of the prayer

“Your golden orb masks the entrance to truth and reality, like a lid on a golden vessel. Oh, Sun, remove this covering to reveal truth and reality.” This prayer is taken from the Ishavasyopanishad.

## Introduction to Asanas

In Grade 7, we explored several asanas that helped improve our balance, concentration, and flexibility. This year, we will learn new @sana to enhance stability, balance, and flexibility. We will also focus on how to perform these asanas with ease and effortlessness.

Yoga is known for its many practices, but dsanas is the most popular. Some people even think that practising dsanas is all that yoga is about! there is to yoga! Long ago, spiritual seekers


## Yoga

193

7/16/2025 5:24:18 PM


## 07_Unit 6.indd 194

used dsanas mainly to prepare us for meditation. Today, we understand that asanas can also help us manage the challenges of daily life.

In the Yoga Sutras, Maharishi Patafijali described asana asa means to cultivate a positive mindset. However, it is important to remember that dsanas are more than just physical exercises. They should be practised carefully and slowly, with full attention and awareness of the breath. Asanas teach us how to care for and maintain our physical bodies. When we practise them, we use them as a foundation to turn our attention inward.


## As the Yoga Sutra of Patafijali describes—


## eee ore


## Sthirasukham asanam | (2.46) © FG Dw»

That is, the posture should be steady and comfortable.

This is key to performing dsanas. It means that we should aim for physical and mental stability and comfort in any posture. Sthira means ‘steady’, so holding the posture steadily is important. When you first start practising, it may feel challenging and even a little uncomfortable. However, do not worry! With regular practise, the dsana will become easier and more comfortable to do. Asanas are often categorised into various groups to help us understand and practice them better; these include meditative, cultural, relaxing, and balancing poses.

Before learning new dsanas, we must reinforce our understanding and practice of the ones we explored in the previous grades. These postures, which include poses like Ardhakati chakrasana, Padmasana, Bhujangasana, Shalabhasana, Utkatasana, Sarvangdsana and Matsydsana, are beneficial for building strength, flexibility, and balance. By revisiting these dsanas, we reinforce our understanding of their correct techniques and prepare our bodies for the more challenging dsanas that we will learn in this Grade.

In this Grade, we will practice the following dsanas:


## ¢ Standing - Virabhadrasana (Variation II), Garudasana


## ¢ Sitting - Pashchimottandasana, Parivritta Janu Shirshasana, Suptavajrasana, Utthita Padmasana

Prone - Dhanurdsana


## ¢ Supine —- Pavanamuktdsana

Perform each dsana under the teacher’s guidance and follow the steps provided.

For safe and effective dsana practice, remember the following


## guidelines:

e Always begin with warm-up exercises, such as Sukshma Vyayama to prepare your body. Practise on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning. Breathe naturally through your nose with slow, deep breaths, and wear comfortable, loose clothing.

e Avoid strain and overstretching; listen to your body’s signals. Focus on proper alignment and maintain a calm mind during practice. Conclude with a relaxation posture, such as Shavasana, and strive for consistent, daily practice for optimal benefits.

For additional guidelines, please refer to the Grade 7 textbook. Virabhadrasana (Warrior Pose) - Variation II

Virabhadrasana, also known as the Warrior Pose, is named after the mighty warrior Virabhadra (Vira meaning ‘warrior’, Bhadra meaning ‘best’). This legendary figure, associated with Sadashiva, arose from Lord Shiva’s anger to fight injustice, famously destroying Daksha’s yajna. He symbolises focused strength and righteous power.

Practising this pose helps us connect with that warrior spirit, developing physical strength, flexibility, and balance. Mentally, it cultivates the determination, courage, and confidence needed to face life’s challenges, just like Virabhadra.

Lie comfortably on your back in the Savasana pose. Gently close your eyes and relax. Take a few slow, deep breaths in and out. Remember to breathe calmly. Let us begin by focusing gently on the right foot. Feel the right foot relaxing as you keep the attention there for a moment. Now, slowly shift your focus up to the right knee, right thigh, and finally to the right hip. Be aware of the entire right leg and feel it relaxing.

Now, gently shift the focus to the left foot. Feel it relaxing as you hold the attention there for a moment. Slowly move the focus up to the left knee, the left thigh, and finally, the left hip. Become aware of the entire left leg, allowing it to relax completely.

Now, bring the attention to the lower body— your pelvis (lower limbs), stomach, navel, and chest.

Bring attention to the right shoulder, right arm, palm, and fingers. Do the same for the left shoulder and left arm, palm and fingers. Next, focus on the throat, face, and the very top of the head.

While in this relaxed state, take a deep breath in. Notice how the body feels, and relax and enjoy this peaceful stillness for a few minutes.

Now, slowly become aware of the body and the space around you. Gently roll onto the right side and stay there for a few more minutes.

When you are ready, slowly sit up. Take the time, and when you feel comfortable, gently and gradually open your eyes. You can then rub the palms together to create warmth and gently cup them over the eyes.

## Kriyas

Kriyds are special yoga techniques designed to purify the body from the inside out. While we all practice some form of cleansing daily, like bathing or brushing our teeth, yoga kriyas go deeper, targeting the internal organs. Over time, yogis have developed many kriyas, but six major ones, called the Shhata Kriyds, are considered the most important and comprehensive.

They are:

Neti - Cleaning the nostrils

Dhouti — Cleaning the digestive tract Basti - Cleaning the bowels.

Nault — Rolling the abdominal muscles Trataka — Gazing at one point


## Oa Fr Wn


## Kapdlabhati — Cleaning the frontal region of the brain

In this grade, let us learn more about Kapdlabhati. Kapdla

means ‘skull’, and bhati means ‘shining’, so Kapdlabhati means ‘shining skull’. In the Hatha Yoga texts, it is classified under


## the

Shat Kriyas. This practice involves active, rapid exhalation,

while inhalation is a passive process.


## Pra

ctise guidelines While practising Kapalabhati, keep the body relaxed.

Never force the breath during the practice; start with 10 to 15 exhalations.

Practise this on an empty stomach. Try to maintain a steady rhythm throughout the practice. Girls should avoid this practice during menstruation.

Sitina comfortable posture, such as Vajrdsana or Sukhasana, with the spine erect, face relaxed, and eyes gently closed. Adopt Chin Mudra.

Inhale once, then exhale rapidly, like a blacksmith’s bellows, drawing the abdominal muscles inward as the air is expelled through the nostrils.

This practice can be performed for 10 to 20 exhalations, depending on one’s capacity.

When the practice is stopped, the breath halts automatically. This state is called Sahaja or Kevala Kumbhaka, and it is considered the most critical aspect of Kapdlabhati, which must be experienced.

When the breath stops naturally, the mind also becomes still, which is the ultimate goal of yoga practice.


## Khel Yatra

¢ Kapdlabhati helps eliminate excess Kapha doSha, particularly mucus that accumulates in the head-neck region.

¢ It improves upper and lower respiratory health.

It balances and strengthens the nervous system.

¢ It enhances focus and concentration.

It provides a gentle massage to all the abdominal organs.

## Chapter 4

Our daily habits, from exercise and work to sleep and even food, greatly affect Prana. Prana is the vital energy needed by our physical and subtle layers, without which the body would perish. It is the prana, or life force, within us that nourishes the mind and keeps the body alive. In our bodies, our thoughts, feelings, and imagination have an even stronger influence on this energy.

While often described as breath control, Pranayama is more than just breathing exercises. The word Yama means to control or regulate, usually referring to rules or codes of conduct. Pranayama goes beyond simple respiration, and is best practised after performing dsanas (yoga postures) as part of a complete yoga routine.

Before we learn Pranayama in this Grade, let us review our practice from the previous Grade, such as Sectional Breathing, Nadishuddhi Pranayama, Bhramart Pranayama and Bhastrika Pranayama.

For safe and effective Pranayama, remember these guidelines:

e Always breathe naturally through your nose.

¢ Sit comfortably with your back straight. Start slowly, gradually increasing your practice time.

¢ If you feel dizzy or have respiratory issues, inform your teacher immediately.

Remember, Pranayama is about gradual progress, so consistent practice will bring positive changes.

(Refer to Khel Yoga Grade 6 textbook for the above practices).

In this Grade let us learn additional Pranayama practices such as Surya Bhedana Pranayama and Chandra Bhedana Pranayama.

Notes for the teacher * Ensure students do equal rounds in both nostrils and do not overdo the practice. * Encourage students to share their experiences after the practice.


## MUDRAS

Mudras are gentle yet powerful movements, often involving the hands, that act like a silent language of your body. These movements can shift how you feel, think, and see the world around you, making you more focused and aware. Sometimes, a mudra uses your whole body, combining adsana, Pranayama, and focused visualisation. Ancient yoga texts consider mudras a key part of yoga, best learnt after you are comfortable with basic yoga practices, as they help to refine the inner awareness and clear any major energy blocks.

In this Grade, let us learn how to perform Tadagt Mudra.


## Tadagi Mudra: The Pond Gesture

In Sanskrit, ‘Tadag? (dsl) means a human-made pond or reservoir, and ‘Mudra’ (451) means a seal or gesture. So, Tadagt


## Khel Yatra

218


## 07_Unit 6.indd 218

Mudra is like creating the shape of a pond with your body in a seated forward bend. This yoga pose involves sitting, using a specific breathing method, and focusing the mind, including gently drawing the stomach inward. It combines body, breath, and awareness to create the ‘pond gesture’ (mudra). This mudra should be practised on an empty stomach early or at least three hours after the last meal.


## Step-by-step instructions for Tadagi Mudra


## Come to Danddsana

STEP 1: Sit with the legs stretched out and feet slightly apart.

Close your eyes and relax the whole body, especially the abdominal region.

STEP 2: Now slowly lean forward and grasp the big toes with the thumb, index and second finger.

STEP 3: Keep the head facing forward, now inhale slowly and deeply, expanding the abdominal muscles to their fullest extent.

STEP 4: Now, exhale slowly and deeply while relaxing the abdomen. Repeat the breathing for 5 times and then slowly release your toes and return to Dandasana.


## Relax in Shithila Dandasana.

Tadagt Mudra strengthens the diaphragm and tones the pelvic floor muscles.

¢« This mudra improves the appetite and cures digestive disorders.

7/16/2025 5:24:32 PM


## LIMITATIONS

e Students who have undergone recent surgery and hip or leg injury should avoid this practice.

¢ Students with heart disease and hernia should avoid this practice.


## Notes for the teacher

Students can attempt three rounds in one session and gradually progress to five rounds.

Ensure students do not move their body while doing the practice.


## PRATYAHARA

Pratyahara, is the fifth limb of Ashtanga Yoga, which teaches us to focus our minds by gently drawing our attention away from distractions. It is like turning down the noise of the outside world to better hear what’s happening within us. Pratyahara is a practice that helps to calm our mind by training our five senses (sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell) to draw nourishment from within, rather than just from the outside world.

The word Pratyahara comes from Sanskrit- Prati means ‘away from’, and ahara means ‘nourishment.’ Thus, Pratyahara refers to withdrawing the senses from external stimuli. Think of it like a tortoise drawing its limbs into its shell for protection; in the same way, Pratydhara teaches us to withdraw our senses from distractions gently.

By practising Indriya Pratyahara—the control of the senses— we learn to turn our attention inward. When you want to concentrate, try gently pulling your awareness away from what you see, hear, taste, touch and smell. With regular practice, your ability to focus will strengthen, as if placing a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your mind to preserve your concentration.


## 220 Khel Yatra


## 07_Unit 6.indd 220

Here’s a verse from the Katha Upanishad.


## eorrree

“That is called Yoga, where the senses are controlled and held steady.”

ACTIVITY .


## My Inner Tortoise Shell

Sit in a comfortable place with your eyes gently closed.

Try to focus on your breath, even when there are many distractions around you. For example, noises or a yummy smell from a bakery might pull your attention away.

Now, imagine you are like a tortoise. Slowly and gently, pull your senses inward, like a turtle drawing its head and legs into its shell.

¢ Sight: Gently stop focusing on what is in front of you. Imagine your eyes are closed—even if they are open—and focus only on the darkness behind your eyelids.

¢ Hearing: Try not to pay attention to the sounds around you. Instead, listen only to your quiet thoughts.

e Smell: Gently ignore any smells in the air. Notice the air as it comes in and out of your nose.

¢ Taste: Be aware of the taste in your mouth, but do not try to change or focus on it too much. Just let it be.

¢ Touch: Notice how your body is sitting or resting. Observe the sensations, but do not get too involved in them. Just be aware.

Take a few slow, deep breaths while your ‘senses are inside your shell.’ Notice how your mind feels a little quieter and more still.


## Yoga #221

7/16/2025 5:24:32 PM

07_Unit 6.indd_ 222

After a minute or two, gently bring your awareness back to the outside world. Notice how you feel.

Think about how it felt to pull your attention inward gently. Did it help you feel more focused or calmer? This simple practice is a little taste of Pratydhara, learning to create your own ‘inner shell’ to protect your focus. You can try this anytime you need to concentrate.

This skill can also be helpful in many situations, like studying, paying attention in class, or dealing with overwhelming feelings.


## DHARANA, DHYANA AND SAMADHI


## Notes for the teacher

Read the activity beforehand to familiarise the students with the steps and the intended experience.

You may choose to play soft, calming background music.

Briefly discuss how focusing inward can enhance students’ learning and understanding.

Encourage students to share their experiences.

Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi are limbs of Ashtanga Yoga that help calm and still the mind. These practices are about learning to control the mind and improve focus. In them, the mind becomes the most important tool. Understanding how our mind works is the key to being healthy and happy— these three practices support this understanding. They lead to a state where we can control our thoughts, gain wisdom, and experience deep peace and joy. Essentially, they involve training the mind to concentrate on one specific object.

Focus means keeping your attention on a single point. It has two main aspects— first, it involves keeping the mind within a specific boundary, not allowing it to wander. Second, even when many things try to distract you, focus is about actively choosing to stay with that one thing. Focusing takes effort, and the more distractions there are, the harder it becomes.


## 222 Khel Yatra


## What is Dharana?

This ‘spot’ for meditation could be a thought, an object, or a sound (like a mantra). Fixing the mind on one of these is called Dharana.

Dharana means ‘holding’ or ‘absorbing’ focus and is about concentrating ona specific area or object. Itis not about focusing on a tiny point but rather about keeping the mind within a specific boundary. You can focus on many things, depending on your intention. For example, some ancient teachings suggest focusing on the navel to understand the human body or on the throat to control hunger and thirst. You might also focus on a statue, the story of a wise person, or even the breath. Practising Dharana helps us become more aware of ourselves and less ignorant. It makes the mind more stable and less prone to wandering, bringing peace and emotional balance.

In this grade, let us learn the art of focusing through the practice of Jyoti Trataka.

Our eyes are amazing organs that allow us to see the world around us. However, with its stresses and increased screen time, modern life can negatively affect our vision. Yoga offers a practice called Trataka, which may help reduce stress and improve specific eye problems.

Trataka means ‘steady gazing’ or ‘concentrated viewing.’ It is a practice where you focus on an object or a symbol. In Jyoti Trataka, we use the light or flame of a lamp as the point of focus, and preparatory exercises are performed before practising it.

Let us now follow a step-by-step preparatory practice for Jyoti Trataka.

7/16/2025 5:24:32 PM


## 07_Unit 6.indd 224


## Sit in Sukhasana or Vajrasana.

STEP 1: Tilting left and right with the right eye closed Close your right eye. With your left eye open, gaze at the light while tilting your head to the right and left. Do not blink. After a few rounds, do simple palming.

STEP 2: Tilting left and right with the left eye closed Now close your left eye. With your right eye open, gaze at the light while tilting your head to the right and left. Do not blink. After a few rounds, do simple palming.

STEP 3: Bending forward and backwards with the right eye closed Close your right eye. With your left eye open, gaze at the light while moving your head forward and backwards. Do not blink. Then do simple palming.

STEP 4: Bending forward and backwards with the left eye closed Close your left eye. With your right eye open, gaze at the light while moving your head forward and backwards. Do not blink. Then do simple palming.


## Khel Yatra


## Notes for the teacher


## ¢ During the practice, use dim light.

« Ensure the students move their heads gently and slowly.

Encourage students to do palming after each step to relax.


## Preparation of light

In a darkened room (the room does not have be completely dark), place a lamp or candle on a table. Have students sit in a circle around the table, each about an arm's length away from the other. Carefully light the lamp or candle.


## DHYANA

Dhyana is like a smooth, steady stream, like oil flowing without interruption. It is a state of deep focus where your mind is completely absorbed in one thing. Think about the times when you have been so immersed in a game or music that you did not notice anything else— that is a taste of Dhyana.

In yogic texts, Dhyana is compared to a smooth stream of oil. When oil is poured from one vessel to another, it flows seamlessly, like a continuous stream—Tailadharavat. Dhyana should be continuous, like Tailadharavat.

Now let us practice simple meditation techniques, step by step.

e Sit comfortably in Sukhasana or Vajrasana, with your spine erect and eyes closed.

¢ Slowly move your awareness to your breath. Observe your breathing for a few moments as you inhale and exhale.

e If thoughts arise in your mind, don’t worry. Gently bring your attention back to your breath.

¢ Practice this for a few minutes. This is Dhyana, focusing on your breath and allowing your mind to become calm and peaceful.

7/16/2025 5:24:33 PM


## Samadhi

Samadhi is like reaching perfection in something you have practised for a long time. Think of a master musician who plays their instrument so well that it seems like an extension of their body. That effortless skill and oneness with the instrument is similar to Samadhi. It is a natural state that happens when you have truly mastered something.


## Krida Yoga

Krida means play, but it is much more than just fun and games. It is vital to healthy development, fostering physical and mental well-being. Krida Yoga is an inherently joyful activity, driven by our natural desire to move and explore. It does not require strict rules or pre-planned outcomes. It is about active participation, not just watching. When we engage in Krida, we often create our own ‘rules’ and explore movement without the pressure of being ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’


## Namasmaranam

Namasmaranam is an indoor game, normally played in groups. This game improves memory.

Nurturing emotional well-being during the transition phase

Growing up, especially during the exciting yet sometimes overwhelming period of adolescence (ages 10 to 19), you can


## Yoga #227

7/16/2025 5:24:35 PM


## 07_Unit 6.indd 228

face many rapid changes in your body, mind, and feelings, including puberty. To navigate this transition smoothly and blossom into healthy adults, it's crucial to develop positive ways to handle challenges. This involves understanding our culture, being mindful of our thoughts, staying determined in our efforts, and choosing supportive friends.

When it comes to managing emotions during this time of change, it's very important to remember that if you're experiencing emotional turbulence, reaching out is key. Talking about your feelings and sharing them with a trusted elder, teacher, or counsellor is much healthier than keeping them bottled up or isolating yourself. Practices like meditation can also be incredibly helpful in understanding and balancing your emotions. Besides this, engaging in creative activities, pursuing hobbies, and spending time connecting with nature through nature walks can also play a significant role in maintaining emotional well-being. By building these positive values and skills, you'll be better equipped to stay healthy, happy, and make good choices as you mature.


## Yoga practices for anxiety and anger management

While anxiety and anger are natural responses we all experience when faced with life’s stresses, intense or frequent feelings can negatively impact our well being. Yoga provides us with valuable tools to manage these emotions. A consistent daily practice that includes loosening exercises, Surya Namaskar, asanas, relaxation techniques, Pranayama, Mudras, and Dhyana can help us navigate anxiety and anger, leading to a calmer and more balanced life.

It’s important to remember that while yoga is a powerful support for coping with everyday stress and preventing intense feelings, it is not a replacement for professional help. If you find that frequent or intense anxiety or anger significantly disrupts


## 228 Khel Yatra

your daily life, reaching out for guidance from health experts is a positive step. Seeking help from a counsellor or psychologist is normal and should not be considered something to avoid. Just like we seek help for physical health, taking care of our mental and emotional well-being is equally important.

NOTE: Adolescents often experiences frustration and anger when they cannot

get what they want. But did you know that these feelings can start with our own thoughts?

The Bhagavad Gita, explains it this way—lIf you keep thinking about something you like, you start to become attached to it. This attachment then grows into a strong desire to have it. When you cannot get what you really want, this desire can turn into anger.
