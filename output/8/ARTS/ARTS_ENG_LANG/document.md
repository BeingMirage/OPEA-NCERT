## FOREWORD

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages an education system that is rooted in Indian ethos, and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while simultaneously preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects, and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities (touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the panchkoshas), in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages has paved the way for the progression of their learning, further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8.

At the Middle Stage, the NCF-SE 2023 aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await

three languages— out of which at least two languages native to India, Science, Mathematics, Social Science, Arts Education, Physical Education, Yoga and Well-being, and Vocational Education will promote their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate and interactive textbooks in different curricular areas, which will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction, and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions—classroom arrangement, technology integration and_ teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within, and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is committed for providing students with such high-quality textbooks. The various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, artists and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Kriti, the textbook of Arts for Grade 8 is one

them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects, namely of these.


## ET I I IO


## PS NNN EMCO EMENT


## Prelims.indd 4

The contents of Kriti encompass the art forms of Theatre, Music, Dance and Visual Arts. This textbook is for the learners to explore their creativity as well as express and explore themselves. Kriti has infused in its visuals and other components, the rich Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, and values—all deeply rooted in Bharat. Inclusivity of all genders and students with special abilities is inherent to arts giving equal opportunity to all students. Making optimum use of technology integration, QR codes have been embedded throughout as additional learning resources.

For all practical purposes, Kriti has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals—to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of theme and content and develop the core competencies at this stage as

envisaged in the NCF-SE 2023 for creativity, exploration and experiences of different art forms. The sections and chapters are intelligently designed to accommodate and encourage all students to experience various activities. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders.

At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

## ABOUT THE BOOK

The Arts form one of the fundamental subjects to be taken by all students in the Middle Stage— as recommended by the National Education Policy 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework 2023—to widen students’ horizons, expand expressive abilities, broaden cultural literacy and appreciation, and develop creative practices. Continuing the themes and concepts introduced in Grades 6 and 7, this textbook of Arts for Grade 8, Kriti has been developed to enrich further comprehension. It has four sections—


## || || for Theatre || || for Music


## || || for Dance and Movement


## || || for Visual Arts

Apart from the exercises, activities and information given in this book, there are many examples of practical and creative ideas that can be accessed by scanning the QR codes. Let it be clear that the assessment in Arts Education aims to make learners creative with critical reflection and analysis. Perfection in art is not the criterion at all, and practicing in multiple ways independently and in teams is the roadmap for an enjoyable and healthy artistic endeavour.

Here’s how the textbook wishes to approach different concepts.


## THEATRE

The Theatre section in Grade 8 is an amalgamation of the various skills and techniques learnt in the previous grades, along with newer insights into various aspects unexplored so far. Students develop themselves in Grade 8 by creating their own script as a team. Here, the students not only share and write stories, but also look at integrating other art forms learnt so far-like puppetry, mime, dance and music— into scripts. Once their script is ready, they decide roles, assign teams for costume, set and props, and eventually perform a full-fledged play with minimal support from the teacher. This process helps the class to immerse themselves in the process of theatre-making. It gives them a first-hand experience of the minor details involved in the development of a play. Finally, they are introduced to the field of theatre appreciation. Understanding the perspective of a theatre audience by writing their own review gives them a different perspective of looking at a theatrical performance. As they complete the Middle Stage with a play production, they are all set to explore more specialised details in the next stage.

The journey evolves by delving further into swar, laya and shabd, the basic components in Music. The multifaceted expressions of Music like reciting shlokas in Sanskrit through swar and


## Prelims.indd 6

laya patterns, singing songs in various regional languages of India (folk or traditional), performing jingles or playing signature tunes used for promotion of products, and practising complicated patterns of the seven notes in different layas—are all pedagogies that aim to explore the vast and flexible domain of Music. Along with them, acquiring basic skills in singing and playing of musical instruments, including nuances of both Hindustani and Carnatic Music for rendition of ragas, and presentation methods are also a curricular focus. Interdisciplinary concepts such as how science and music are connected, and an insight into the construction of musical instruments, are also given. While stories of some inspiring musicians are provided, students are encouraged to learn about musicians in their community and understand their contributions. A section is devoted to encouraging students to start introspecting about how to continue making music a part of their lives. There are a variety of careers associated with music today. These involve not only the knowledge and interest in music but also the connection of music to technology, design, healthcare, etc. While an introduction to careers has been given, students are now of an age where they can explore such ideas themselves, with inspiration and guidance from the teacher.


## DANCE AND MOVEMENT

Dance continues to build on learning from previous classes, focusing on the principles of rhythm and movement. This year, students are introduced to the concept of breath or prana

in dance, the principles of stithi and gati, and the building of dance phrases to be strung into a complete performance. They are introduced to the eight major dance forms of India, while continuing to learn about other traditional dances and the important personalities of dance. Importantly, they focus on understanding and expressing their emotions as a cathartic experience. They also learn about the Indian martial arts and their incorporation in dance. The textbook also maintains a focus on inclusivity and social change through dance. In the final chapter, they present a performance integrating all their learnings in the arts, with focus on interdisciplinarity.


## VISUAL ARTS

This section aims to strengthen and extend fundamental knowledge and skills in the Visual Arts.

The first chapter deepens the learners’ understanding of elements and principles of visual art and design. The second chapter enables them to envision a still life composition in colour. They are able to find objects meaningful to them and arrange them appropriately. The third chapter focuses on the techniques of perspective drawing as wellas ratio and proportion of the human body to increase their abilities and confidence in drawing. The fourth chapter draws attention to art in their everyday life and the practices that have been continuing over many generations. This chapter also gives opportunity to reflect on sustainable practices by working with everyday materials like fibres, cloth and paper to create beautiful artworks. The

27-06-2025 15:15:27

fifth chapter urges them to reflect on their own knowledge in using basic design skills and creating a campaign to raise awareness about art and its practices.

A variety of activities are designed in each chapter to help students experience and learn skills in Visual Arts that will be of use to them in their journey ahead.


## INTEGRATION OF ALL ART FORMS WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES

The pedagogy in Arts Education for the four art forms in Grade 8 ensures that Kriti will educate about the basic concepts in different art forms and also open a world for learners

to celebrate the incredible artistic legacy of India. It will be interesting for students to see how activities in each art form integrate with other disciplines like Science, Mathematics, Language, and Social Science, offering a holistic approach to education. Thus students will explore an interesting and engaging world of arts in Grade 8.

## TIME ALLOCATION AND ASSESSMENTS

The Arts textbook contains four sections, each dealing with a separate art form. It is important to plan the timetable in a way that distributes the learning of all art forms equally across the year.

As per the NCF-SE 2023, the time allocated for Arts for the entire academic year is—100 hours (or 150 periods of 40 minutes each).

This book has been written keeping in mind this time allocation.

It is preferable to have all four art forms distributed across the week as the progress of all sections would happen simultaneously. It is better to avoid a system where one art form is taken up after the full completion of the other.

Under the Illustrative Timetable of the NCF-SE, Arts has been allocated 4 periods during the week and 1 period on Saturday. The document also suggests the use of block periods, where two periods (40 minutes) are combined to make enough time for activity-based classes. This would give a continuous stretch of time (80 minutes, i.e., 1 hour 20 minutes).

Based on these options the four art forms could be allocated the four periods on weekdays, and Saturday could be used for activities that are interdisciplinary or for taking students on art- based field trips, like concerts, performances or art galleries.

progressing simultaneously as it would enable the students to understand the inter-connections between the art forms in order to get a holistic understanding.


## ASSESSMENT

Assessments in Arts play a crucial role in understanding, and nurturing students’ creative abilities and artistic growth. Unlike other subjects, Arts assessments focus on evaluating a wide range of skills, including creativity, critical thinking, technical proficiency and expressive capabilities. These assessments are designed not only to measure progress and mastery but also to encourage exploration, self-expression, and a deeper appreciation for the arts.


## METHODS OF ASSESSMENTS

As the assessment processes are primarily skill-based, it is not dependent on the ‘correct or wrong answer’ given by the students. It is, therefore, important not to structure ‘tests’ with question papers and written answers. This would entirely defeat the purpose of the approach used in the Arts curriculum. A variety of assessment methods such as portfolios, performance reviews, project-based evaluations and reflective self-assessments can give insights into each student’s unique artistic journey.


## FORMATIVE AND SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENTS

“» Formative assessment is based on observations in every class and the performance of the student in each activity. Rubrics provided at the end of each chapter help in structuring the scores or grades through the year.

“> Summative assessment is to have a separate day allotted for assessment. Activities conducted in class during the year and its variations can be used to assess the understanding, and ability of the student in the skills and competencies. Examples are given at the end of each section to enable better planning. Whatever is suggested spontaneous creation by students is a merit to be rewarded.


## GRADES AND SCORES

Since, art is about creativity, visualisation, expression and imagination, it cannot have correct or wrong answers. Scoring here, is therefore, based on parameters of the level of skill acquired and the competencies acquired by the students. The teacher is to be completely familiar with the competencies and learning outcomes for each activity in order to have a fair assessment through scores.

A 5-point scale is suggested for marking in every criterion. This would enable teachers, parents and students to get clarity on how they are progressing. The table below can be used as a reference to mark the 5-point scale in the rubrics that are provided after each chapter.

It is important to combine both quantitative assessment (scores or grades based on rubrics) and qualitative assessment (teacher’s observations on the student’s behaviour, interest, progress and other aspects that may not be mentioned in the rubrics).

Dear Theatre Teacher,

As the students of Grade 8 are crossing a milestone by completing the middle stage of their creative and dramatic journey, this is the time for consolidation and confidence-building.

At this stage, the young learners are not just performers in the making, but also thoughtful collaborators and reflective individuals. This book has been designed to assimilate all they have explored in the previous years—from movement, and expression to storytelling and stagecraft. The activities and exercises in these pages will help the students fine-tune their theatrical skills, sharpen their communication, and cultivate a sense of responsibility—not only as artists, but also as teammates, problem-solvers, and critical thinkers.

This book encourages students to step up as powerful performers and capable backstage crew, giving them tools to plan, rehearse, review, and reflect. It honours the craft of performance while also emphasising discipline and ownership—values that will serve them far beyond the stage.

Let this be a year of exploration, expression and excellence, where the rehearsal room becomes a


## ee i

mirror, a stage, and a stepping stone. The curtains are ready to rise. Along with you, the show will go on—with purpose and pride.

This is one of the crucial parts of the entire process of studying theatre in school as a mainstream subject. Though it is important to have marks or grades like in every subject, it is also essential to keep the spirit of theatre intact, and not reduce it to a pen and paper exam with a question paper. The final outcome or presentation is not the only benchmark. The thought and process behind the activities also need to be considered with —


## Knowledge application Effort and participation Creativity and presentation Teamwork and collaboration

Read the section on time allocation and assessments at the beginning of the book for better clarity. Assessment for Theatre has been planned at different levels.


## SSS

==. = —— —

This is to be done in class after completing the activities and chapters, at two levels —

Circle time—A process followed after every class and every activity. The teacher sits with the students in an informal setting (to get honest responses from students) to ask questions about what they did. They share their thoughts and experiences, based on which the teacher makes notes about each student. Some questions are given in the textbook. The teacher can explore more questions based on the class’s response.

Rubrics—Upon completion of every chapter, a rubric has been shared with the desired learning outcomes that the teacher can mark. The student is also asked to grade themself based on their perception of their performance in that chapter. This self-analysis is also a feedback for the teacher.

This will be an

activity-based test conducted at the end of the year. The activities need to be a combination of the lessons learnt during the year. The assessment is conducted at an individual and group level to assess different skills and competencies. A set of sample activities has been given at the end of the section.

Reading the script of a play is the first step towards creating a full- fledged production. But did you know that this first step itself can become the final performance?

Play reading as a performing art Voice training Impactful speaking

Rehearsed reading or stage reading is a form of theatre.


## REHEARSED READING

Rehearsed reading is performed without any set, props, costumes or make-up. The actors, dressed in regular clothes, sit on chairs on the stage and read the lines of their character aloud.

However, it is much more than just reading aloud. It is an art that brings characters, emotions, and stories to life. To make this happen, every word, pause and expression has to be given equal importance. Then, each dialogue becomes an engaging experience.

This experience not only sharpens the imagination but also connects the text directly to the audience, without the need of any visual enhancements like set or costumes.

You may say it sounds simple—“That’s so easy... I can do it.”

Of course, you can do it! But this also requires a lot of hard work, practise and effort. The only difference is—all the effort goes towards perfecting your voice,

This process is similar to a singing practice. Both work on your vocal cords, pitch, volume, and the emotion it evokes!

Slightly different forms of this are—radio plays, voice acting and dubbing. The concept is the same, but it does not happen on stage.


## “» Emoting through speech

All these aspects are completely dependent on your physical body. You cannot take support of any equipment or instrument to enhance the effect. So, let us first understand how voice is produced in our body.

While most of us assume it is from the vocal cords, you will be surprised to know that vocal cords are among the varied parts of our body that help us produce a wide range of sounds, speech and voices.

## GD VOLUME AND PITCH

Although the concept of volume and pitch are prominently used in music, it is very crucial for theatre students to learn this, as good acting depends entirely on it. You can refer to your music lessons while practising.

Volume is how loud or soft a sound is. You must have tried this while playing music on your gadgets. In theatre, controlling volume helps the emotions and messages to reach the audience. This is true even in our everyday lives. Don’t you scream loudly if you are angry? Animals use them too. Lions roar loudly to show power and dominance — as if declaring, “This is my territory!”, in a booming voice. Whereas, a cat meows softly to show comfort and affection. Similarly

in theatre, loud volume can express strong emotions like anger or joy, while soft volume can portray sadness, fear or kindness. Learning to adjust the volume helps to express emotion more clearly and connect better with the audience, just like animals communicate their feelings in the wild.


## 9 | BRINGING WORDS ALIVE — PLAY READING

Pitch is how high or low a sound is. A high pitch often shows excitement, fear or playfulness, like how you scream when you get a surprise gift. A low pitch can suggest seriousness, calmness or anger. For example, when a mouse squeaks in a very high-pitched sound, it is usually scared or excited. In contrast, a bear growls in a deep and low pitch sound to warn others or show aggression. In theatre, actors changes their pitch to bring characters to life, for example, a childlike character speak in a high pitch, or a wise old king speak in a deep and low tone. Mastering pitch helps to create different personalities and express a wide range of emotions.

Since we are looking at the examples of animals to understand this concept and whatit can communicate, here is a simple table to help you understand it better. Notice the different combinations of volume and pitch of each animal.


## 10 | KRITI


## ANIMAL | VOLUME | PITCH EMOTION


## Power, dominance


## Fear, excitement


## Wisdom, calmness


## Threat, fear


## Alarm, fear


## Aggression, threat

| ACTIVITY 1.3: GUESS THE ANIMAL EMOTION! | 1.3: GUESS THE ANIMAL EMOTION!

Here you can become an animal, an animal that shows human emotions! Match the sounds of animal with emotions using the volume and pitch. One of you can come to the front and makes an animal sound. But they must pick an emotion secretly (happy, scared, angry, sad, or any other emotion), and adjust their sound. The rest of the class guesses the animal and the emotion based on the Volume (loud/soft) and Pitch (high/low).

You can try different combinations of animals and emotions. For example, a happy lion might give a soft growl, where as a scared mouse might let out a super tiny squeal. You can try a happy and angry dog, or a tired and excited goat.

Remember: Try not to use expressions or body language that might give away the emotion. This activity requires you to use only your voice.

## | ACTIVITY 1.5: EMOTING THROUGH SPEECH | 1.5: EMOTING THROUGH SPEECH

SPEAKING WITHOUT LANGUAGE!

Have you ever wondered how every word we speak has a meaning attached to it? If we spoke random sets of words with no meaning, would we still be able to communicate?

Communication depends not just on what we say but also how we say it. In fact there are instances when we don’t know the language of the person speaking to us, but we still manage to get the gist of what is being said. How is that possible? This is because the human brain can receive inputs beyond a learnt language. The brain receives

information from the tone of the voice,


## facial expression, body

language and the context when it is spoken.

Let us try an experiment where we assume that each of you have come from a different planet and speak a unique language that nobody

else understands. You have to make up sentences with a set of


## random sounds. This kind of

speech is called gibberish.


## ch-1_theater.indd 12


## BASIC

When you put together some random sounds, no one is likely to understand. Now, try saying this in a particular emotion. Say the same gibberish sentence like you are annoyed with your friend who is disturbing you and not letting you study. Use your voice, action and expression to convey this. Now, most of your friends can make some sense of what you are communicating. Combine it with volume and pitch to help in better communication.

Now, try the same with different emotions and situations. Let the other students in class guess what you are trying to say. Everyone gets a turn to communicate with gibberish. How many of them could you understand?


## ADVANCED

The next level would be to try and have a simple conversation in gibberish! Sit with a friend and speak a sentence with emotion. Let the person respond to you. Continue this for about 4—5 lines. Now, stop and share what you actually meant.

You can also put yourself in different situations for this conversation, like a village fair, an office, school playground, etc.

27-06-2025 11:16:36


## Note to the Teacher:

Look out for students

who use simple gibberish instead of complex gibberish. A complex gibberish has many combinations of syllables and sounds, compared to a simple gibberish.

Example of a simple gibberish, “Tata tatata ta ttaat tatata. Or papapa pap papa paapapa papapap”


## Complex combination — ‘tagutta mo le bo ungji ko"

Encourage the students to use multiple syllables, and change the rhythm of the sounds.

The most fundamental aspect of any performance is the script. It is important to write down your ideas and thoughts on paper to develop them further. In fact, that is why this textbook is written. It will not be enough for a teacher or a mentor to just talk about a concept and assume that you have understood and will remember it. Writing helps in multiple ways such as —

“> Bringing clarity “> Building on idea with more creativity “> Sharing with others for collaborative work

“> Helping youremember and refer back when required “> Acting as record for future generations

Writing takes many forms. You might be familiar with short stories, essays, poems, letters or emails, articles, or blogs. Not just that but every movie, TV show, web series, news telecast or documentary you watch also has a detailed scripts written for it. Writing, in it’s various forms, is the invisible thread that ties all communication together.

## SCRIPTS FOR STAGE

Play scripts are written works intended for the performance on stage, in film, or on television. Depending on the kind of performance they are designed for they vary in structure, style and purpose. Some of the most common types of play scripts are listed below. Each type of play script serves a different artistic purpose, reflecting human experiences in unique ways. Understanding these types allows us to appreciate the diversity of theatrical storytelling.


## PLAY SCRIPTS IN ANCIENT INDIA

Ancient Indian thinkers use the term rupa or rupaka for drama. The ancient Indian writers mostly use a term drushya kavya (visible poetry). The writings usually combined the dialogue and poetry. So, all the Sanskrit play writers were also poets. The Natyashastra describes the different types of writing drama! Let us compare it with the current types of scripts—

ACTIVITY 2.1: SCRIPT YOUR STYLE!

According to the Natyashastra, the first written script was a Samavakara (the 7th in the above list) by Brahma. It was based on the Amrita Manthana. As the process of creation of the performing arts, (Natyotpatti, learnt in Grade 6) had a discussion, and debate between the Devas and the Asuras, Brahma thought it was appropriate for the first performance to be about them. The Amrita Manthana (churning of the ocean) by the Devas and Asuras, is a significant event

that has been depicted in different parts of the world. The picture above is an iconic representation of the Suvarnabhumi Airport

Note to the Teacher: Though the above activity requires only one page, encourage the students to extend their writing and build the story creatively. They can also try multiple styles to explore the possibilities.

This activity can also be extended to writing assignments of other subjects, such as Language or Social Science.

However, there are also writings in which the features of two genres are combined. In such cases, though the predominant theme is considered, it is listed under both categories. For example, tragicomedy is a blend of tragedy and comedy, the play mixes the serious themes with moments of humour and relief.

Genre is necessary because it provides a framework for understanding and interpreting texts. A piece of writing can be written in different ways depending on the context. The reader or the audience may not know the state of mind or the intent of the writer. This might lead to mis-interpretations and complications in understanding the text. Stating the genre helps avoid this problem.

It facilitates better organisation of works. For example, if you go to a public library or a book store, you will see books classified based on the categories of genre. It makes it easy to access as you won’t have to look among thousands of books everytime!

Now, we enter the exciting world of theatre-making! This is where ideas turn into action, and stories come alive with teamwork. In this chapter, you won’t just read about theatre—you will create it! From planning a scene to rehearsing lines and designing costumes to setting the stage, you will discover how every small role builds the big picture. As you are at the end of middle stage, this is when you will put together everything you have learnt so far.

From costume design and make up, to puppetry and mime; and from writing your own script and dialogues, to acting with emotion and voice.

Recall all your lessons, so you are ready to turn your imagination into a performance! Let the theatre-making begin!

This chapter intends to take you through the entire journey—from an idea to a successful performance. To make it interesting, this process is written as a play script itself. This script is about the students of Grade 8 working towards putting up a performance on their own. It assimilates all the steps you have

The date of the show is also announced. The countdown has begun and the students are excited, nervous and unsure of how they can do it. Ananya, the class representative starts by addressing the class.


## SCENE 1: BRAINSTORMING

(A classroom with excited students busy discussing in groups. The board reads ‘Annual Theatre Project’.)

Ananya: Alright, as per the memo we have just received, our school show is in just six weeks. The play should be 30 to 40 minutes long. Let’s give our best and make this the best experience!

Karan: Yes, we should be the best! So, first, we need to find a great story. Should we do comedy, mystery or fantasy? Oh... but before that, who is doing the documentation? Photos, videos? We have to keep a record of this event—we are doing our own show!

Ananya: Oh, yes! Glad, you remembered! I can do it. I love taking pictures!

Meera: Can we do a Panchatantra or a Hitopadesha story?

Ritu: (hesitating) What about a folktale? Or, an Indian story? We could add some classical or folk dance in it.

Meera: Yes! And we could mix it with puppetry or mime. It will be fun!

Anil: (excited) Oh! I will find some great instrumental music like dholak and sarod.

Ananya: Perfect! So, an Indian story it is. Let’s all suggest stories from our native regions and shortlist one.


## Tara: How about the tale of Savitri and Satyavan?

Seema: Or, Tenali Rama? Something with humor and wit.

19-06-2025 15:26:16

Ananya: Hmm... but wait. We’ve got three good ones. Savitri and Satyavan is emotional, Tenali Rama is witty, and ‘Monkey and Crocodile’ is fun and visual. How do we choose? Should we vote?

Ritu: Can we mix elements? Maybe Tenali’s wit, but with animal characters like the monkey and crocodile!

Meera: That could be chaotic!

Anil: I think we should focus on something simple but dramatic. But there are so many stories.

Ananya: Let’s take five minutes, everyone think and vote.

Karan: (confidently) I know a very interesting story of an old wise woman from the mountains of Himalayas. My father told me that story. Do you want to hear it?


## Everyone: Yes!

(They huddle, discuss and finally settle on the Himalayan folktale with elements of dance, puppetry, and folk music.)

Ananya: Done! I think this story has a_ great beginning— middle, end, and an interesting conflict as well. Can we start writing the scenes and dialogues? Who can do it?

Karan: (strongly) I will write the script. But I will need help. Who can join me?

(Three more students agree to join Karan in the script writing and forming a team.)

Ananya: So, Karan and his team will work on it together. Can you give us the final script in three days? That way, we can start planning the rehearsals.

Ritu: Don’t forget to include dance, puppetry and folk music. I want to do the choreography.

Karan: Sure. We will give it in three days. But as we rehearse, I might want to add a few lines here and there to improve it.

Ananya: That is fine. We can always keep improving.

Meera: (disappointed) But I also like dancing. I wanted to work on the songs as well. I have been going to


## ch-3_theater.indd 30

dance classes since, I was five years old. Now, I can’t do it since Ritu is doing it.

Ananya: Hey! No... that’s not how it is! You can definitely work together. This is all going to be a team work. You and Ritu can work together on selecting the songs and planning the steps.

(Ritu and Meera happily give high-five, and sit together to discuss.)

Ananya: Since we have already made two teams, I think we can also assign the other teams, so we are all ready by the time the script is complete.

(Ananya writes the names of all teams on the board and asks everyone to volunteer. After some discussion, they have the following.)

1. Script—Karan, Nitin, Shama and Rekha 2. Set and props—Nikhil

3. Make up and costume—Ishaan, Tara and Seema


## Puppetry— Anita 5. Music—Anil


## 30 | KRITI

6. Dance—Ritu, Meera

7. Documentation— Ananya

Ananya: (anxious) What about the others? We need more people for puppetry, music, set and props! Please volunteer. Aditya, Neetu, Priya, Sriram... choose your team!

Aditya and Sriram: (sounding disinterested) We want to select roles and act on stage. Can’t do this work.

(Nobody wants to do these things. The rest of the class also say they want to act on stage. Despite repeated

19-06-2025 15:26:19

requests, nobody volunteers to work. Ananya, feeling helpless, requests the teacher to help.)

Teacher: Great start, I really like your story! But remember, backstage work is most important! You learnt in Grade7thatallthese departments are a foundation for a good performance. Everyone in class has to be a part of at least one of the groups written on the board. You can also act, after the script is given. You all have to put effort as a united team. (looking sternly) Come on...! start picking your team.


## everyone.

(Understanding this, the remaining students select various groups and start working.)

(3 days later —students are working in groups. Karan and his team are writing; Ritu and Anita are drawing and cutting out puppets; Aniland Meera are working on musical notes with beats, and steps. They occasionally

run to the teacher for help and suggestions, and come back to work on them.)

Karan: (loudly announcing) We have almost completed the script. Can we read it for you? (everyone nods and looks towards them.)

Scene 1, an old house on the Himalayan slopes. A granny is sitting, reading a book. Her grandson comes to her and says, “Naani, I’m hungry”. The grandmother goes to the kitchen, gives him a snack and later, they start playing a game together.


## ch-3_theater.indd 32

Ritu: (rolling her eyes) I think the opening is very boring. Remember, we learnt last year that you should capture your audience’s attention in the first scene.

Karan: Hey, wait... it is coming up! I have read only one line so far! (continues)

(As they are playing, they hear a loud scream outside. They rush to the window and see that a big spaceship has landed on the mountain, and all the neighbours are looking at it in awe.)

Nikhil: Karan, we can’t show all this on stage. How can we make a spaceship land? How can we show mountains? You have to write something that is practically possible.

Karan: (annoyed that no one likes his script) Please wait and listen to the whole thing. You don’t have to make mountains on stage. All this is depicted only through the conversation between the grandmother


## 32 | KRITI

and grandson as they look out of the window. Can I continue now? (continues)

The boy is scared and says, “Naani, what is that? Will it harm us?” The grandmother says, “Nothing can harm us if we are strong and brave. Let us go out and see”. But the boy runs and hides under the cot.

Anil: This seems like a modern story—with a space-ship and all! What next? Aliens will come out of it (laughs loudly). This is a futuristic play. Not a folk play!

Meera: Yes! It is not a folk story at all. Where can we bring in dance? (in a teasing tone) I can’t do


## a folk dance with aliens!

Anita: I can’t think of puppetry either, for a story like this.

Karan: (angrily) Ok...fine. You write the script yourself. Nobody wants to listen. I can’t continue writing like this (puts down the script on the desk with a thud and walks out).

Ananya: (quickly runs out and brings him back and addresses the class) Karan and his team have worked hard to come up with this.

19-06-2025 15:26:23

First, let us listen to the entire script. It is important to give feedback as it will help him improve the script. But let us not interrupt the reading. We have to respect each other’s work. He too knows what we can show on stage and what the school allows us. I am sure he has kept all that in his mind along with the dance and puppetry, while writing. (Karan nods in agreement.) You can continue reading Karan. We will make notes and share it at the end.

(They all listen, make notes, share and discuss. Karan makes changes based on some suggestions. At the end, everyone looks happy and confident that their play is going to be great!)


## SCENE 3: REHEARSALS AND PREPARATION

(It has been a week since practice has started. Roles are allotted, preparation is in full swing. Tension is in the air as students are arguing.)

Nikhil: This is chaos! Everyone’s using my costume corner like a dumping ground! Every time I arrange the costume designs in order of the script, someone messes it up.

Ritu: I need space to dry the crocodile puppet! Anita! (shouts) Please help!

Karan: My script team can’t focus with all this shouting. You have suggested changes and now, you don’t allow us to work! We can’t even remember your suggestion for Scene 3. So much distraction!

Meera: And don’t even ask about dance rehearsals. No one’s showing up!


## ch-3_theater.indd 34

Anil: I composed three songs and now the dance team says they want something else! I can’t keep doing this.

Ananya: (shouting louder, trying to calm them) Guys! This is not working. We’re supposed to be a team!

Teacher: What’s going on here? Why is there so much noise? The other classes are complaining!

Ananya: No work has been completed and we only have a week before we present it to the teachers.

Karan: Everything’s falling apart. We’re stuck!


## 34 | KRITI

Teacher: (smiling) That means you're right on track.


## Everyone: Huh?

Teacher: Every team hits a wall. It’s part of the creative process. You’re all passionate and excited—that’s good. But now, step back, breathe and listen to each other.

Ananya: We’ve all been so focused on our own parts that we forgot—this is one story, one show.

Teacher: Exactly. Here’s a tip—use a


## common storyboard chart so. all

departments are aligned. Find different

places to work. You can look for empty rooms or even go to the playground. Hold a combined check-in every two days.

Karan: Right! That’s a great idea. When we meet, we can act out each scene briefly and let all teams visualise what’s needed!

Anil: Pll coordinate with Ritu and Anita. I have to work on music for dance and puppetry separately. (Meera glares at him) Okay...okay...no more remix surprises from film music, promise!

(Everyone laughs.)

19-06-2025 15:26:26

Teacher: Good! Now, back to work. Find your places. Don’t disturb each other. But remember, you are all one team. So work together.


## SCENE 4: THE FIRST RUN-THROUGH

(In the school auditorium. Only about 4 to 5 teachers are watching. Students perform one scene after another. Lots of mistakes. More laughter. They complete performing and sit in a circle for feedback.)

Ananya: Sorry ma’am... there were a lot of mistakes. We had practised... but...

Teacher 1: Actually, completing it from beginning to end is a huge task in itself! You have to clap for your team. Well done!

About your corrections, the scene transitions were slow. You took a lot of time to shift from one scene to another. You need smoother scene changes. Who is in charge of set and props?

Nikhil: It’s me. I too felt we took a lot of time to change set and props for each scene. I think we’llarrange all the required props, scene wise. That’ll help cover the time. We lost a lot of time running around to fetch props.

Teacher 2: Good thinking. Also, project your voice more. I couldn’t hear some of your lines clearly. You have to be aware of the stage-voice. It does not mean you have to scream. You should be able to hold emotions and yet project your voice in such a way that it is audible to the last row.

Ananya: Thank you, ma’am. We’ll fix these before the final show.

Teacher 3: I really loved how you used puppetry to depict the little boy’s dream. The connection between the music of puppetry and the folk dance is a brilliant

## Whispers. Music tuning. Actors in

Ritu: Puppets, ready? Sana: The stick was broken. Just replaced it... done!

Ananya: (anxious) It is almost time for the show! Let’s do our team prayer!

(Everyone makes a circle and hold hands. The teacher too joins them.)

Teacher: All of you have worked very hard. I know you will put in your full efforts. The chief guest, has already arrived. We can have a discussion with her after your show. I’m sure you will get good feedback. Now, close your eyes, take a deep breath and start the prayer.

Meaning: Whatever I do with my body, speech, mind or sense organs, through my intellect, or unconsciously by the natural tendencies of my mind, all those, I do for the Supreme Being, without sense of attachment to the results. I surrender them to the lotus feet of Sri Narayana.

(Teacher wishes the best and goes to sit among the audience. Students get together.)

19-06-2025 15:26:28

Everyone: One team, one show; let the magic flow!

(Actors take position. Stage lights up. Show begins. One scene after another, it flows. Third scene, Aditya has to enter. Other actors, Suraj and Nandini are waiting... Aditya is nowhere to be seen. If he doesn’t say his line, puppetry can’t begin. Tension. Actors don’t know what to do.)

Nandini: (deciding to manage the situation, takes on Aditya’s line) Oh! Both of you are here, I wanted to take you to the mountain to show something interesting. Come with me! (exits)

(Puppetry begins. Audience clap in excitement. Final scene. Music rises. Dance weaves in and the story concludes. As all the actors and backstage team

assemble on stage for a curtain call, the audience is silent. The team is tense. Did they not like it? Did they not understand? What mistake did we do? A second later, the chief guest stands and applauds wholeheartedly, congratulating them.)


## Audience: (all standing) Bravo! Amazing!

Teacher: (teary-eyed) I am so proud of all of you. Ananya: (on stage) Thank you for joining us on this journey. We learnt more than just a story. We learnt teamwork, creativity and that every part matters.

(Whispering to Nandini) Thanks for saving the show! Aditya fell backstage and sprained his leg.

Everyone: The great show ends... but our theatre journey has just begun!

What are the immediate thoughts in your mind after reading the entire play? Relatable? Felt like it was happening in your class? Did you have any questions? Write down your immediate thoughts here. You can also make drawings or doodles of what is on your mind.

You can share and discuss the points you have noted with the rest of the class, and see what others think about it.

Now, let us analyse the play script and see what we can learn from it.

Each scene has different elements of theatre-making that you can learn and apply in the process of preparing for your performance. We will discuss it scene-by-scene.

You can also refer back to the scenes to identify parts of theatre-making. Note to the Teacher: It is advisable for the students to put their ideas together and create a script of their own, for the performance. Using the script in this chapter or a ready script is not preferred. Doing this would prevent the students from applying the lessons learnt in Grades 6 and 7 in script writing.

Note to the Teacher: As mentioned in the script, the teacher is to play only a supportive role and let the students build it on their own.

The students should take decisions and solve problems. Allow them to make mistakes. Provide suggestions and tips only when they need help.

Don’t forget the journaling and documentation. It is an important part of any production. Record using photos or videos along with written records. This is done through regular diary entries of your process.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS — LESSONS FOR LIFE


## Theatre Motto: The Show Must Go On—Your Superpower for Life!

As students of theatre, this is a line you should never forget. Even if a crown falls off, someone sneezes loudly, or the lights goes out—actors

don’t stop (ike Nandini managed the above play). The audience sitting in front of you have given you their time (and sometimes money—for tickets). You owe it to them. It is the responsibility of every theatre person to make sure that the audience is not disappointed. So, no matter what happens, they smile, improvise and keep the story alive! That’s the

magic behind ‘The show must go on’.

For you, it is like having a superpower in real life! When a plan goes wrong, or when you make a mistake, you don’t have to freeze, panic or quit. Just take a deep breath, think quick and move forward like a star. It teaches resilience, adaptability, and the courage to stay calm even when things don’t go perfectly. In daily life, challenges, mistakes and surprises are natural. But just like actors on stage, we learn to continue with confidence, do our best and

not give up at the first sign of trouble. It reminds us that perseverance and a positive attitude are often more important than perfection. Life is not about being perfect—it’s about being brave, smart, and unstoppable, no matter what! Because just like the show, life goes on!

Here is a real-life story of a show performed in a school, where the students demonstrated the undying spirit of theatre —

In the year 1995, in a town in the Dharwad district of Karnataka, a team of school students was presenting a drama production before an audience of more than 200 people in an auditorium. It was an old auditorium with pulley operated backdrops to depict different scenes like forest, palace, etc. During the performance, the lead actor was standing right under the backdrop when the ropes snapped and the backdrop started falling down, she heard the sound and noticed the backdrop slipping down, but did not move or stop her dialogue! She hoped and trusted the backstage team to do something, and was determined not to disturb the flow of the play.

Almost as if on cue, two backstage crew members who noticed this, immediately ran to both sides and held the ropes by hand. This kept the backdrop in position. But they couldn’t move as it meant it would fall off, if they let go. So, they held the heavy backdrop by hand for one full hour, till the play was completed! What about the other work they were supposed to do backstage? The rest of the team came to help and took over their work, and managed the entire show without a glitch! The hands of the two crew members were completely bruised and bleeding. The audience was very happy with the play and praised the team.

For this reason, the joy and satisfaction of having completed a show successfully was so high that all the trouble that the team went through, was forgotten. With team work and determination —the show went on!

As theatre performers, you are putting all your effort & a (backstage and on stage) to LNG . <p make sure that the audience is happy. But as you perform, you also have certain expectations from the audience. Don’t you? Some basic behaviour and understanding of the hard work you have put, along with some applause and support after the show.

As you have been told in the previous grades that watching performances makes you a better performer, it is now important for you to understand the responsibility and duty of being a good member of the audience—for any performing art.

Being a good audience for the performing arts When you sit among the audience, you are just as important as the actors on stage! Your duty is to—

** Watch and listen respectfully, giving full attention to the performance.

** JItis important not to talk, fidget or use phones.

Being a good audience for the arts Review writing

Applauding at the right time, reacting kindly and appreciating the effort of the performers.

The above list has very simple requirements on whatis to be done (applaud, appreciate, congratulate, offer help), and what is not to be done (disrespect the performers and distract anyone with your actions). This very spirit is reflected in the 27th chapter of the Natyashastra, that talks about the success of a performance. The third

stanza speaks about how the appreciation must be communicated to the performers—


## anushi sid SCN

It mentions that the expression of success can be in two ways— 1. Vocally—through words — speech, exclamations and writing.

2. Physical body—through actions—clapping, standing up after the show for respect and giving gifts.

In this chapter, we shall look at how you can use the first option—write about the performance and be a good audience to the arts. The process of writing a performance for the others to read, and understand the elements and spirit of the show is called a ‘review’. As the word itself, it should be so well-written that the reader should feel like it is being viewed again. You review the show! Let us look at the technical definition of a review, which is not limited to performances alone. Reviews are done for books, products, paintings, projects and even sports along with movies, music, drama and dance concerts.

Reviewing is the process of thoughtfully observing, reflecting and giving feedback on a performance, product or experience. It involves looking closely at what worked well, what could be improved and how effectively the goal was achieved. Good reviewing is not just about finding faults. It is about appreciating strengths, noticing details, and offering suggestions. It sharpens critical thinking and helps everyone to improve.


## es


## 48 | KRITI


## ch-4_theater.indd 48

Reviewing in theatre is a special skill where you not only watch a play but also pay attention to how well the actors perform, how the story is told, use of voice, movement, costumes, lighting and even sets. It is not about criticising. It is about celebrating what made the performance powerful and suggesting how it could connect more deeply with the audience. Theatre reviewing trains you to be a careful observer, a sensitive listener and a respectful communicator.

There are three types of reviews —

“» Self-review— When the creators themselves examine the art and check for ways to improve before presenting it to the audience.

“» Peer review—Contemporaries in the field provide suggestions, either before or after the show.

“ Criticalreview — Itis obtained from everyone after the show, which includes a detailed analysis of all the aspects of the performance, including the scope for improvement, strengths and weaknesses.

Let us start reviewing!

Being a reviewer does not mean you can just go and sit in the audience. It is your responsibility to prepare for it!


## ACTIVITY 4.1: PLAY WATCHING

As theatre students, you not only do theatre but also watch plays. You learn more by watching. Any language of any genre. Watch a play whenever possible. Request your teachers to plan field trips from school to watch plays together. You can also watch plays with your family and friends, as a fun activity. Make sure you write a review for every performance you watch. The steps given in this chapter will help you.

The circle time, an activity you have

been doing after every chapter is a form of review exercise for every activity!

27-06-2025 15:20:31


## Research the Play

= Find out the name of the play, playwright and the basic plot (without spoiling it!).

= Understand the time period or setting, if it is famous or historical.


## Know the Genre

= Is ita comedy, tragedy, musical, historical drama, or a modern play? This helps you watch with the right mindset.

Find out about the Theatre Team that is Performing

= Find out about the group performing —are they professionals, students or a community group? It helps in understanding their point of view.


## Keep a Journal

=" Carry a small notebook to quickly jot down thoughts during or right after the show.


## Your Mindset

Go with an open mind—be ready to enjoy and observe.

A reviewer must be honest but also fair and

respectful. Holding a bias towards the team or an actor will not make the review honest.


## Revise What You Intend to Observe

Acting — Was it believable and emotional? Set design — Did the stage support the story?

Costumes — Did they match the time and character?

Lights and Sound — Did they add to the mood?

Story— Was it clear, engaging or confusing? Flow —Is there a smooth flow from one scene to another? Are the entries and exits smooth within a scene?

Errors that were visibly evident— How were they handled?


## Have No Expectations


## 49 | APPLAUSE AND ADVICE

Every production is different. Don’t expect it to be exactly like a movie or a previous version you may have seen.


## 50 | KRITI


## ch-4_theater.indd 50


## WRITING A REVIEW You have watched

the performance, made key points in ® your notepad and have a lot more points in your = >

mind, waiting to be expressed. But there are some points to keep in mind before you do.

,

** Don’t be mean or personal — Critique the performance, not the person. Never insult an actor, director or team.

“> No spoilers —If the story depends ona surprise, don’t ruin it for others.

“> Avoid using single phrases like ‘it was not bad’ — Explain why you thought it was good or needed improvement. Justify your opinions.

** Havea balance of positives and negatives —

Even if you didn’t enjoy the play, find and


## mention something positive too. The main

purpose is to help the team or individuals improve and do better.

¢» Neither too long nor too short — Find the balance—detailed but easy to read. Around 300 words is good for beginners.

Now, how do you write it?

With all these points in mind, you can start writing. Though you can make it creative in your presentation, such that it reflects your unique style, following a structure will help put things in order and also making it easy for the readers.

1. What did you learn about being a performer after understanding the review process?

2. Is it easy to review your own work or the work of others? Which is more important?

3. Are you able to accept reviews from others as fairly as you give your reviews to others?

27-06-2025 15:20:35

Look at the pictures and write a small review based on your understanding.

1. What is the genre of the play?

2. What is the scene being enacted? Observe each actor and their action. You can guess and write creatively a few possible dialogues.

3. Your opinion on the lighting, costumes, make-up and props?

The:sound which is pleasant to the ears of human beings and which has been aesthetically structured with swar and varna (tenets of aroha, avaroha and other special

features) is termed as raga by the knowledgeable.


## ‘“ —Matanga’s Brihaddeshi, Chapter 3, Verse 264

The students must have noticed that music is an integral part of our lives, alive in almost every activity we undertake. They surely feel that musical traditions which have prevailed in our country deeply enrich their lives. They realise how people naturally turn to songs to express themselves during important moments. Hence, it’s time to let them explore further. When they listen to a composition or learn a song, let them delve into its various aspects: theme, author, beauty of the words or lyrical beauty, different tunes, and rhythmic patterns that form a song. Point them towards the diverse voices of singers. There is so much more to discover. With your motivation they will uncover the vibrant, enchanting world of swara, laya and shabd, that surrounds and captivates us all. Along with the lessons, the assessments should be scientific, rational and systematic. So, follow the guidelines for Formative Assessments given at the end of each chapter, which should be conducted in a relaxed and engaged manner, and mainly through observation in the classroom. The suggestions for Summative Assessments are provided at the end of the music section. The competencies required for this stage are given below. The main aim of assessments

is to see whether students are able to reach the competencies laid out or whether more support is needed. Give students qualitative feedback at regular intervals to help them develop further.

## DISCOVERING THE | 5 | ELEMENTS OF MUSIC

INTRODUCTION | ACTIVITY 5.1: RANGE. | 5.1: RANGE

Welcome back, students! When we listen to a piece of music or sing a song, we observe that it is made of constituent elements.


## 0879CHOS

Earlier we learnt about the concept of vocal range, that indicates the span from the lowest to the highest note you can comfortably sing. Extending your range is a great way to develop your singing.

These vocal exercises help you practise the lower register (mandra saptak) of your voice. When practising, remember to keep your head and neck in a neutral position to avoid straining your voice or throat muscles.

Do you notice a pattern here?

Some of the main elements of music are—melody (raga), rhythm (tala) and lyrics (sahitya). In this chapter, we will discover further aspects of rhythm, melody and lyrics, and observe how they come together when we sing


## Group performance by children


## VOCAL EXERCISES

Here are some exercises to help develop your voice in different ways.

Can you create a similar pattern to extend your range in the higher register (tara saptak)?


## ACTIVITY 5.2: FLEXIBILITY ACTIVITY 5.3: WARMUPS IN HARMONY

These vocal exercises help you develop flexibility in your voice. Sing them slowly and increase the tempo of practice as you get comfortable.


## SARGAM IN TEENTALA

In Grade 8, we learnt to sing canons, which are a first step in learning to sing harmony. Now, let us sing these vocal warmups.

» First sing the lines together as a group.

» Then divide into two groups, with each group singing one part (simultaneously).

Try singing this in two groups at the same time:


## WARMUP IN. THIRDS


## Harmony

Different notes can be sung at the same time to produce a pleasant effect. This is called harmony.

Singing in harmony is a wonderful example of collaboration. Playing a duet or a jugalbandi is another example. Can you think of how you can carry forward these principles of harmonious collaboration to other areas of your life?

Note to the Teacher: Explore forms like avaiyya, abhang, etc. What are the compositions trying to convey?

ch5_MUSIC.indd 58 27-06-2025 11:20:55

| ACTIVITY 5.4: SANSKRIT VERSES AND RHYTHM | 5.4: SANSKRIT VERSES AND RHYTHM

There are many verses in Sanskrit composed by various poets and philosophers. These verses are set in a particular metre or pattern. This is referred to as chhandas in Sanskrit. Thus, while Sanskrit verses are chanted as a devotional offering, they can also give us an understanding of rhythm.


## Meaning

(Salutations to him) Who resides in the spiritual heart centre as omkara, on whom the yogis constantly meditate.

Who grants all desires and also liberation to his devotees. Salutations to that Shiva, who is represented by syllable ‘Om’.

When you recite these verses a few times, you may observe that the syllables naturally follow a pattern of 4 which is also anushtup chhand.

You can even clap your hands while reciting, to understand the underlying rhythm pattern.

SHLOKA AND CHHAND (METRE)

Here is a shloka which you can recite in ‘Anushtup Chhand’.


## HDS TALA, KONNAKKOL AND SWARAS

As you may remember, konnakkol is the rhythm language of Carnatic music. We have looked at some simple konnakkol patterns in the previous years, now let us learn to sing or recite a konnakkol phrase in adi tala.


## ACTIVITY 5.5: KONNAKKOL IN ADI TALA


## 1st speed: 1 count per beat 2nd speed: 2 counts per beat

3rd speed: 4 counts per beat . ivf a] Ss 8 akshara phrase: ThaKaDhiMi ThaKaJhaNu (4 + 4 = 8 akshara) School choir

:

Observe the proportionate change in total number of syllables each time the speed changes. Can you relate this to a mathematical concept? Discuss.

ch5_MUSIC.indd 60 27-06-2025 11:20:59


## ACTIVITY 5.6: SWARAS IN ADI TALA

Now, let us repeat the same exercise, but instead of using konnakkol patterns, we will use swaras.

## ACTIVITY 5.9: LEADING AND PARTICIPATING IN AN ENSEMBLE

In Grade 7, you have practised chorus singing and canons, try to incorporate what you have learnt into any group song.

» Rehearse the song multiple times. *» Present it before the class.

s Learn any song. *» Form groups of 15-20 students.

» You can also repeat the activity by shuffling the roles.

Assign roles to each team member. Some possible roles—

e Conductor: the one who ensures the whole performance is synchronised


## e Lead singer


## e Chorus singers


## e Instrument players

e Providing support by clapping or body percussion


## o

“» Now, work together to ensure that each team member has a clearly defined role and is aware of it.


## ch5_MUSIC.indd 64

A music ensemble or band is like a team with many different roles. Some members willbe lead singers, others will be in the chorus. Some will play particular instruments. However, it is important to realise that each member of the team is important for a_ successful performance.

## THE SCIENCE OF SOUND VIBRATION

Sound is produced because of vibrations. When an object vibrates, it creates sound waves, that travel through a medium (air, water, etc.) to reach our ears.


## e/ oS


## RINGING


## BELL VIBRATING AIR MOLECULES — LISTENER


## RESONANCE

Through resonance, sound is amplified or made louder. For example, in a percussion instrument, the hollow body or cavity resonates, amplifying the sound.


## FREQUENCY

Frequency is the number of vibrations per second. A faster vibration produces higher frequency, resulting in a higher pitch of sound. For example, tightening the tuning peg of a Sitar increases its tension and vibrating frequency, resulting in a higher pitch.

## GED MAKING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS

The makers of musical instruments are essential for the survival of traditional art forms. Scientific principles are used in the making of musical instruments.

The head of the drum is created.

It is then fixed onto the wooden drum.

The instrument maker works with a log of wood to create a cylindrical shape.

Straps are tied to help with tuning.

Note to the Teacher: Find an instrument maker in your community or local area. Invite them to the school for a live demonstration of the process of making and maintaining musical instruments. This will give the students a first-hand idea of the importance of these craftspersons in our society.


## MUSICIANS AND THEIR INSTRUMENTS

Musicians often become synonymous with their instruments. Here are some great musicians and their instruments for you to learn about. If you can, learn about other great musicians from our country!


## ANNAPURNA DEVI — SURBAHAR r

\ :; Annapurna Devi (1927-2018), born Roshanara Khan, was one of the most influential figures in Indian classical music. She was the daughter of the legendary Baba Allauddin Khan of the Maihar Gharana and


## 68 | KRITI

played the surbahar, a bass sitar known for its deep, resonant tones. The surbahar was an uncommon instrument for women as it is considered physically demanding, but she mastered it and her father considered her his finest student. Although she did not perform publicly, Annapurna Devi was known for her commitment to tradition and her mastery over ragas. Her students, including flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia and sitarist Nikhil Banerjee, became some of the most acclaimed musicians of their generation.

ABOUT THE SURBAHAR: The surbahar is a plucked string instrument, often called the ‘bass sitar’, used in Hindustani classical music. It has a deeper and lower tonal range than the sitar, making it suitable for elaborate alaap sections.

18-Jun-25 12:28:12 PM


## PANNALAL GHOSH — FLUTE

Pannalal Ghosh lived from 1911 to 1960 and his name was synonymous to Indian flute (bansuri). He was a bansuri player and also a composer. He was a disciple of Baba Allauddin Khan, and is credited with popularising the flute as a concert instrument in Hindustani classical music. As a child he had picked up a small flute that cowherders usually played and on the basis of the education he was receiving on the sitar from his father, he would try to play musical patterns on the flute. At the age of 18, he started focusing his attention on the flute. Ghosh realised that a bigger flute’s pitch and sonority would be more appropriate for both classical and light music. Ghosh experimented with various materials including metal and different types of wood, and decided on using bamboo. He finally settled on a flute which was 32 inches long.

He assisted in music production while he was in Calcutta working with New Theatres Ltd. In 1940

he came to Bombay, to further expand his music career. Sneh Bandhan (1940) was his debut film as an independent music composer. The popular songs from the film were “Aabroo Ke Kamaanon Mein” and “Sneh Bandhan Mein Bandhe Hue” sung by Khan Mastan and Bibbo. Pannalal Ghosh jointly scored the background for “Aandhiyan” in 1952 along with Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar. He was the first to introduce the seven-hole flute.


## MYSORE DORAISWAMY IYENGAR — VEENA

Doraiswamy Iyengar was born into a family of renowned Carnatic musicians in 1920. His father Venkatesh Iyengar served as a Court musician at the Royal court of Mysore, who was efficient equally in flute and Veena. Iyengar started learning the Veena from his father at an early age of 6 years and later went to become the disciple of Veena Venkatagiriyappa. Later, he developed a distinctive style of playing the Veena often referred to as the Mysore Bani. He spent his early years in the village Gaddavalli in Hassan district, Karnataka.


## 69 | MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS


## ch6_MUSIC8.indd 70

He was nominated for Asthana Vidvan (Royal musician of the court) of the Mysore court, one to receive this honour very young age. Apart from giving performances, he was engaged in imparting musical knowledge to the members of the royal family.

He was appointed as the Music Director at the All India Radio in Bangalore. He was credited with several awards and titles. The University of Mysore

conferred upon him an Honorary Doctorate in 1975, the Prestigious civilian award the Padma Bhushan by the President of India in 1983, the Sangeetha Kalanidhi of the Madras Music Academy in 1984, the Sangeetha Kalasikhamani of the Indian Fine Arts Society Chennai in 1994, the Sangeetha Kalaratna of the Bangalore Gayana Samaj, and the Chowdiah National Memorial Award.

## CARNATIC MUSIC

There are seven main talas in Carnatic music. They are:


## . Dhruva

Mattya Rupaka Jhampa . Triputa Ata Eka

The three main parts or angas that make up a tala are: 1. Laghu (clap and finger counts): notated I


## NO’ &WN HE

2. Drutam (clap and wave): notated as O 3. Anudrutam (beat): notated as U

Note: There can be different numbers of beats in a laghu, which is known as jathi. Also, not all talas have all angas.

. 0879CHO7

An important set of vocal exercises to build vocal strength and understand talas is the sapta-tala alankaras, three of which were introduced in Grade 7. In Grade 8, we will learn to sing and keep tala for the remaining four—

## BED RAAG ASAVARI

This raga is originated from asavari thaat. In this raga, the notes—gandhar, dhaivat and nishad—are komal, and the remaining notes are shudh. Its vaadi note is ‘dhaivat’ and the samvaadi note is ‘gandhar’. The ‘gandhar’ and ‘nishad’ are missing notes in aroh (ascending order), due to which the jathi of this raga is audav-sampoorna. The singing time of this raga is the second quarter of the day. A raga similar to this is jaunpuri.

## SD BHAKTI SANGEET AND SUFI QAWWALI

Devotional music in India has its roots in the Bhakti movement, a significant religious, social and literary movement that swept across India beginning from the 6th century CE, and reaching its peak during the 15th-17th century CE. It led to a spiritual revival emphasising devotion, and significantly influenced Indian music, leading to the creation of new musical forms like kirtanas and bhajans. Some prominent bhakti poets include Mirabai and Tulsidas in northern India, and Haridasa saints like Purandara Dasa and Kanakadasa in the southern India.

Similarly, Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam that emerged around the medieval period in India. Sufi saints like Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti and Baba Farid focused on inner devotion and spiritual experience as a means of connecting with god. The Sufi Qawwali genre of music arose from this philosophy and continues to be widely practised and performed, especially in Punjab and the western regions of India.

## INNER DYNAMICS 10 | OF DANCE


## BREATH IN DANCE

According to yogic philosophy, the word ‘prana’ refers to the vital breath of life. The flow of breath that occurs during inhalation and exhalation is known as pranayama.

Dance is also fuelled by this life force, prana.

Dance movements begin with the equipoise, ie., a relaxed spine. Breathing helps to relax the body, especially the spine, which enables the body to move with maximum agility and stability. Breathing forms the link between two seamless dance movements.

Breath plays a significant role in physical dance movements and also while conveying emotions.

In dance, the body stretches, bends and expands better with an inhale, just like in yoga asanas. When it contracts, it does so with an exhale. While holding a static posture, relaxing through the breath and focusing on elongating the spine help to balance and hold the position for longer.

Divide yourselves into four groups.

Each group will hold a dance posture practised in earlier classes. Observe the flow of breath through the movement of your spine.

Then, work out a movement with expansion of the body—for instance, arms outstretched, body bending, elongated movements of the feet while observe how breathing in helps the body.

Next, shift into another movement where there is body _ contraction, such as crouching the body in fear or nervousness, and breathe out while doing it.

Finish it with another static posture with a relaxed breath.

Once each group finishes presenting their movement pattern, discuss how breathing worked for both stillness and movements.

## ED 2. ELEMENTS OF DANCE

Dance is a combination of being static and dynamic. There is a moment of stillness in postures and then, there is motion in movement.

Fundamentally, if you look at any movement — it starts and ends with a static posture. If you are walking from Point A to Point B, there will be a

moment of stillness before you set off from Point A, and after you land at Point B. In between the two is the movement.

## History Trivia

The Natyashastra was written by Bharata Muni in the 5th century BCE. It is the oldest and most authoritative text on dance, and dance-drama. Itis the first written record which discusses all aspects of performing arts. Bharata’s Natyashdstra was included in United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Memory of World Register in 2025.

The Sangita Ratnakara was written by Sharangadeva around the 12th century CE. Sangeeta is a composite term meaning vocal music, instrumental music and dance. This text is special because it is one of the first texts with an independent chapter on dance. The text follows

The postures and movements are described in various dance the natyashastra in all its uniform stylisations, texts, and each dance text offers their unique interpretation which is called margi and also describes various and terminology. regional variations, which is called deshi.

The Abhinaya Darpanam, written by Nandikeshwara around the same time as Sangita Ratnakara was the first book exclusively on dance. Even today, many dance styles continue to refer this text.

The Natyashastra calls postures sthana and ways of moving as chari, gati and mandala.

The Sangita Ratnakara (ocean of sangita) gives us more variations of the same and includes regional variations, deshi.

The Abhinaya Darpanam (mirror of gestures) calls postures — sthanaka and mandala, and depict ways of moving as chari and gati.

## HD 3. POSTURES IN DANCE

According to Ndatyashastra, sthdnas are of three types— standing, sitting and reclining postures.

Standing postures

Think about different characters from everyday life—an older person, superhero, builder, police officer, sportsperson, etc., and discuss their postures they usually stand in.

Based on your observation, strike poses as various characters performing different actions to capture a memorable photographic moment.


## ED 4. MOTION IN DANCE

Motion in dance is a very exciting concept where one can use various levels of postures, speeds, extensions, leaps and pirouettes to move from one place to another. This can depend on the mood and the feel of the character, the patterns of the choreography (like circular or linear), or the action being shown, etc.

There are innumerable ways of moving in dance. As mentioned earlier, each text gives us many variations.

“* According to Natyashastra, = Charis are of two types—bhaumi charis which are earthly movements, where the feet don’t leave the ground; and akashi charis which are aerial movements where the feet leave the ground. A combination of charis makes a mandala.

Think about different ways of moving where your feet are stuck to the ground like dragging your feet, and then think about ways where your feet leave the ground, like leaps, jumps, etc.

= Gatirefers to movements and walks suitable for various characters in the play.

Think about how different characters walk, like a soldier, a baby, a bear, a monkey.


## ch10_DANCE.indd 116


## 116 | KRITI

If you examine your regional dance style, you will notice some forms have repetitive steps, where they move in a particular pattern. For instance, the tippani dance from Gujarat is done while pounding spices—they use their tool (the stick) as a prop and move with small jumps in a circular or linear pattern.

What makes it interesting is that it is not just the dancers who move but the whole group moves together, the sticks move rhythmically, and even the song changes speed, starting slowly and gradually becoming faster.

BHARATANATYAM is a dance from Tamil Nadu, in South India. It is known for its geometric and graceful movements, strong footwork, and beautiful hand gestures and facial expressions. The dancers tell stories using emotions, music and rhythm. Among the many traditions (banis) of Bharatanatyam, the Thanjavur, Pandanallur, Vazhuvoor, and Mysuru styles are especially well-known, though numerous other banis also contribute richly to the form. The dancers stand in a special half-sitting position called aramandi or ayatamandala, shaped like a diamond.

KATHAK, which means storytelling, is a dance form from northern India, particularly rooted in the regions of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Kathak evolved as a form of storytelling through expressive gestures, intricate footwork and graceful movements. Dancers captivate audiences with swift spins, rhythmic foot stamping, delicate hand gestures, and nuanced facial expressions to bring stories to life. Among the many gharanas of kathak the Lucknow, Jaipur, Banaras, Raigarh styles are particularly renowned though several other gharanas have also shaped and enriched the form. They stand tall in a posture called sama sthana, with feet together or ina slight v-shape. The costumes are usually long, flowing dresses like anarkalis or lehengas, with dupattas made from fabrics typical to northern India.

KATHAKALI is a traditional dance from Kerala, primarily performed by men. It is like a colourful play, where dancers act out stories from Indian epics using stylised facial expressions, hand gestures and body movements. There are two styles the northern style known as vadakkan and the southern style known as thekkan. The basic stance in kathakali is atimandala—a deep, grounded posture with knees bent outward and feet placed on the side-foot firmly planted apart. The dancers wear bright costumes, big crowns, and heavy makeup. Their faces are painted in colours that match their characters, like green for heroes, red for villains, etc. Every part of the face is used to convey emotion, while the dance is full of powerful poses and eye movements.

KUCHIPUDI, from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, derives its name from the village of Kuchipudi, which remains home to several traditional dance families even today, such as the Vempati, Vedantam, Bhagavatula of Pasumarthy, among others, who have preserved and passed down this rich legacy through generations. It follows a rich dance-drama tradition and is distinctive for its integration of vachika abhinaya (spoken word) along with an expressive dance. Often theatrical in nature, it includes elements of acting; and at times, dancers perform intricate sequences on a brass plate, showcasing remarkable balance and skill.

Traditionally, it was performed exclusively by men, who often portrayed both male and female roles in the dance-dramas. The basic stance is similar to Bharatanatyam’s aramandi, but is less deep. The dance is distinctive for its quick- footedness, hip movements, leaps, sculpturesque poses and speed. The dancers wear silk fabrics stitched for easy movement, with a special drape called gochi kattu. They also wear traditional temple jewellery.

is a classical dance from Manipur in North- East India. This dance form is soft, gentle and flowing. The movements are smooth and round, almost like gliding. The dancers always look calm and peaceful. The dance includes raas leela (stories of Krishna) and traditional movements from Lai Haraoba. Manipuri dance also includes Sankirtan, a devotional music and dance form performed with cymbals and drums, often as part of temple rituals. A special dance called pung cholom involves playing a drum while dancing, showing excellent skill and coordination. Dancers usually keep their feet together and move circularly with no hard stamping. The famous costume is the poloi dress—a stiff, colourful skirt with a veil and elegant jewellery. The men wear white dhotis and turbans, especially during pung cholom or raas performances.

Apart from the eight major dance forms, there are various other folk dance forms across India. Beliefs, rituals, performing arts, and the symbolism of communities take root in specific social contexts and locations. They bring colour into the monotonous activities of daily life. Born and nurtured in a specific socio-cultural context, each artistic form has its own myth and history. Though folk traditions have changed over time, their basic elasticity has helped adapt to industrialisations and urbanisations.

Dance forms from two regions—Nagaland and Chattisgarh, and their important personalities are given below.


## FOLK DANCE FROM AO TRIBE, NAGALAND

The Ao Naga tribe from the northeastern part of Nagaland celebrates the Moatsu Mong festival as a time of recreation and joy, after the hard work of clearing fields, burning jungles, and sowing seeds. It is marked by vibrant songs, dances and merrymaking. Another major festival, Tsungrem Mong, is observed on the eve of the harvest to offer gratitude to the Supreme Power, with colourful costumes, songs and dances. The Ao Naga have a rich tradition of clothing that distinguishes between commoners and warriors, with the Ao warrior known as

You may recall the various hand gestures you learnt in the previous grades. Each gesture can have a meaning or many meanings and can help you communicate and even tell a story!

Gestures of a single hand are called asamyuta hastas and gestures of both hands are called samyuta hastas.

Let us take this learning a step further.

The Abhinaya Darpanam mentions these hastas in Sanskrit shlokas.

Asamyuta Hasta is a Shloka describing 28 single- hand gestures. Additionaly, there are 4 more hand gestures.

Now, let’s focus on your own feelings—your bhavas. Remember in Chapter 1, you learnt briefly about how breath can also help in Have you ever wondered why, when you watch an expressing emotions. emotional performance, sometimes you also tear up? Or when you watch something beautiful, you cannot stop smiling or feeling happy? It is because the emotion of sadness or joy which is being expressed by the dancer is so powerful, that it touches your heart.

In Grade 7, you have learnt about the resultant experience (rasa) of a feeling or emotion (bhava).

Now, it’s time to try to express emotions (bhava) through dance. Bhava is the first thought, the instant feeling you get when something happens.

Sometimes, experiencing emotions is healing because our deep emotions find an outlet. Think about that one movie, song or dance performance, that made you feel something strongly. It could be an emotion of patriotism, happiness or even sorrow.

ACTIVITY 12.4: DANCE OF MOTIVATION (UTSAHA BHAVA)

Choose a song based on patriotism and choreograph a dance.

Think about what happens when you are scared—you start breathing rapidly with shallow breaths, which causes your body to express fear in many ways, such as perspiration, trembling and loss of facial colour. It is breath that helps in expressing those emotions clearly.


## Trembling


## Loss of facial colour

Note to the Teacher: Teacher may play appropriate music.

ch12_DANCE.indd 138 19-06-2025 17:27:49

Breath itself can be a powerful form of expression, for example, a heavy exhale or sigh to show disappointment.

In theatre, this same emotion would be expressed differently, whereas in dance it would be more stylised, more deliberate. In dance, the entire body, including facial expressions along with the breath, form a way to express your emotions.

Thatis the beauty of the arts; while interconnected, each form has its own distinct language and mode of expression.

You have learnt about two pioneers of the modern dance development in India in Grade 7. In continuation, there are many other dance practitioners and institutions that have been instrumental in developing choreographies using creative movements as well as using traditional dance vocabulary to depict stories of today through dance.

The following are a few among many such artists who have made significant contributions. Each of them has been honoured with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for creative choreography.

One of the senior-most students of Uday Shankar, his many choreographies and dance dramas reflected socially relevant contemporary situations. He is known to create a healthy free dance movement for children, in which his efforts have shown substantial success with the institutionalisation of dance education. He produced over 40 original fabulous works, including notable productions like Kamayani (1970), Wolf-Boy (1977), Antim Adhyaya (1985), and Gandhi (2007). These works were acclaimed for their innovative themes and choreographic excellence.

styles and showed contemporary concepts using

traditional dance forms, for example, creating a scene of the Dabbawalas taking deliveries around the city using kathak footwork, showing the chase between police and thief using the game of ‘hu-tu-tu’. On the traditional dance front, he was the only dance Guru to have researched and choreographed the Marathi compositions of Raja Sarfoji II of the Bhosale Dynasty in Bharatanatyam. He also bridged the gap between theory and practice by choreographing the dance text Abhinaya Darpanam into an audio-visual form.

Chandralekha was one of the earliest dancers who dramatically brought changes in traditional forms and synchronised various Indian dance, yoga and kalaripayattu with philosophy, and literature also. In her production Angika, she presented traditional Bharatanatyam vocabulary of dance based on the principles of Abhinaya Darpana and integrated Kalaripayattu with it. Lilavati was based on Bhaskacharya’s mathematics treatise which she choreographed in dance using numbers, nature and imagination. Prana was based on yoga and breath in dance. She has also worked with modern dancers and actors from the West in experimental productions. She has made films on dance and written on the subject. Among her films are The Myth of Woman (1976) and Hasta (1984).

a pioneering kathak dancer and choreographer who revolutionised the traditional solo format of kathak by introducing group choreography and contemporary themes. Going beyond the traditional repertoire, she asked, “Where do I go from here?”. Thus, her first groundbreaking choreography, Atah Kim, was born. Other creative dance productions were Dhabkar (Pulse), The Coat, Feathered Cloth (Hagoromo) among many others. Her dance choreographies integrated the abstract and narratives, often addressing contemporary themes.

During India’s freedom movement, song and dance inspired everyone. From gender discrimination to climate change, dance has been used to convey complex topics and initiate thought-provoking conversations effectively.

For instance, JNMDA, the premier institution for Manipuri in Imphal, premiered their choreography Keibul Lamjao in 1985 based on the environmentalism of M. K. Binodini Devi’s script, which shows the conservation of the Sangai Deer.

Dance prompts you to think differently, to think out of the box, and view the world with more compassion and love.

What changes can you prompt with your dance?

## A PRESENTATION OF DANCE aoe AND CHOREOGRAPHY oi

0879CHI4

You are familiar with the Natyashdastra and the Abhinaya Darpanam now. In ancient times, when they were written, dance was usually called nrtta and nyitya or nartana, whereas dance-drama was called natya.

Have you ever wondered how dance originated?

If you refer to your Grade 6 Arts textbook (Theatre), you will recall an interesting story about the birth of the performing arts. Similarly, you will learn about the birth of dance from the Abhinaya Darpanam.

Brahma Deva, derived from all four Vedas, is said to have created the Natya Veda, often referred to as called the fifth Veda.

Brahma Deva gave Natya Veda to a Rishi, Bharata Muni, who studied and mastered all three aspects of nytta, nritya and natya.


## CiGEDANCENNGG also}

Bharata Muni along with his group of Gandharvas (heavenly musicians) and Apsaras (heavenly dancers) presented their first performance.

At the time, the great dancer Mahadeva was also in the audience.

He was so pleased to see the performance that he offered Bharata Muni special lessons with his best ganas (attendants) in the rigorous form of dancing called tandava. Mahadeva’s gana, Tandu_ taught tandava to the sages who taught it to the humans.


## TUS 17S


## ch14_DANCE.indd 154

On the other hand, Devi Parvati trained Bharata Muni in the more graceful form of dance called lasya.


## 154 | KRITI

Devi Parvati also taught lasya dance to Usha, the daughter of King Bana. And Usha taught the dance to the gopis (milkmaids) of Dwarka who then taught it to the women of Saurashtra.

And so, more and more people learnt dance, and that is how dance reached the earth.

Legends are a rich source for storytelling in the Indian dance forms. Stories from the Puranas, Jataka Tales, Panchatantra, etc., offer narratives that make for beautiful visual spectacles and have a deep moral message.

These stories are relevant even today when interpreted according to the present times.

## NOTE TO THE

Dear Teacher,

As our students complete another stage of school education this year, let us add more colours to their academic journey with the learning of visual arts. The chapters in this section would strengthen their knowledge of visual fundamentals while also developing their artistic skills and cultural awareness. You can modify the activities to suit your local context and the specific needs of your students.

To create the best learning experience for every student, here are some points that need to be kept in mind.


## THE VISUAL ARTS CLASSROOM WOULD REQUIRE

1. Adequate space for students to work comfortably. 2. Sufficient light and ventilation.

3. Organised storage and easy access to art materials, tools, basic stationery, and audio-visual facilities.

4. Space for showcasing and exhibiting artwork periodically.


## VISUAL ARTS PEDAGOGY WOULD NEED TO

1. Use storytelling and everyday examples to introduce concepts, and processes.

= TEACHERS 2. Encourage students to freely express their


## original ideas, imaginations, emotions and


## curiosities in their artwork.

Motivate students to create original artwork inspired by their observations of everyday life and experiences, rather than copying images from other sources.

Allow the students to explore, investigate, experiment, collaborate and have dialogues in the classroom.

Include outdoor activities and field trips to observe the life, and culture around them.


## Organise visits to museums, heritage monuments and melas.

Invite local artists and craftspersons for interactive sessions, and workshops for hands-on experience.

Inculcate simple habits of cleaning after working, putting back materials that have been used and maintaining materials with care.

Encourage the students’ participation and decision-making in selecting artwork for classroom display or exhibitions.

Visual Arts assessment should be based on the following competencies for the middle stage. C-1.1 Expresses their personal and everyday life experiences confidently through various visual art forms. C-1.2 Demonstrates flexibility in the process of collaboratively developing visual arts practice. C-2.1 Creates visual artwork based on situations or stories that challenge stereotypes observed in their surroundings (such as gender roles) C-2.2 Connects visual imagery, symbols, and visual metaphors with personal experiences, emotions and imaginations

C-3.1 Demonstrates care and makes informed choices, while using various materials, tools, and techniques in visual arts.

C-3.2Refinesideas and techniques ofvisual expression from the stage of planning to the final presentation, and reviewing the entire process.


## c-4.1 Demonstrates familiarity with various local and regional forms of art.

C-4.2 Describes the life and work of a few local artists in their region and across India.

Activities marked by a star symbol %* can be facilitated by any teacher, even in schools with limited resources.

## ELEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES OF VISUAL ART AND DESIGN

Elements of visual art and design are similar to the ingredients of a recipe. For example, halwa can be prepared by cooking a combination of flour, sugar, ghee and water.

Point is a dot. It is the smallest element in any visual.

Line is the visible path that joins any two points. Lines can be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, dashed, wavy, zig-zagged and so on. They can also vary in thickness.


## Shape and form

A shape is a flat, two- dimensional area enclosed by a line. It can be geometric or organic.


## Lion Capital, Mauryan period, circa 250 BCE


## 0879CHIS

Similarly, a visual can be made by

combining elements, such as point, line, shape or form, colour, value, texture and space.

A form is a_ three- dimensional shape. It occupies space and has depth. Forms can also be created by arranging or joining many two-dimensional shapes.

Notice the form of the lion in the image. what other forms do you see?

4. Texture can be visual and physical. It can be sensed by touching a surface that feels soft, rough, grainy, silky, prickly and so on. It can also be perceived visually through patterns of lines and dots.

27-06-2025 17:36:53

Colour is visible when light is reflected and perceived by our eyes. Colours are either extracted from nature or manufactured

synthetically to make dyes and pigments.

Notice the colours in the image, can you guess the natural materials used to create them?

Value or Tone is the lightness or darkness of a colour. Adding white to a colour makes

it lighter (tints), whereas adding black to a colour makes it darker (shades). These create colour gradations.


## Observe the colour tonalities in the painting.

Space is where various elements are organised and composed to create an artwork. Space can be divided into positive and negative space.

Identify the foreground and background in the painting.

Describe the lines and shapes that are painted in this maandana on the wall of this hut. Which other elements do you see?

What are the prominent visual elements in this embroidered tapestry?

Artists constantly experiment with the visual elements while creating artwork.

Let us explore these in the works of three modern Indian artists, who were inspired by the Indian art traditions.

List the visual elements seen in each artwork.

## Shadanga refers

to the six limbs of an art. This has been codified in the ancient Indian text of Vishnu- dharmottara Purana. This text provides guidance on how to combine the visual elements in an aesthetic or tasteful way, while making an artwork.

## GED = PRINCIPLES OF VISUAL ART AND DESIGN

Well-composed visuals communicate ideas and emotions effectively because they follow the principles of art and design. Read about each of the principles and connect them with the painting on this page.

1. Unity and Harmony are created by bringing elements together in a way that is pleasing to the eye. Observe the combination and distribution of colours used in the painting.

2. Balance gives visual stability. For example, if one half of an artwork has a large image, it can be balanced in the other half. Symmetrically, either by a similar and large image or asymmetrically, by many small images. Observe the visual balance in the Tribhanga posture of the mother, and the position of the child.

3. Rhythm and Movement guide our eyes from one part to another in an appealing manner. They are created through pattern and repetition.


## Mother and Child, Jamini Roy, Tempera on canvas

Observe the plant stem next to the mother and other lines on her clothes.

Emphasis is created by making any one of the visual element stand out. Observe the coloured palm of the mother’s hand, holding the flower.

Proportion is the relationship between the sizes of different visual elements. It contributes to the beauty, while also expressing the ideas and emotions. Observe the size of the baby in relation to the mother in this painting.

Hierarchy is the order of importance in a visual. Observe that the mother is given maximum space in the painting. After that, focus on the child, followed by other details of the surroundings.

Around the 16th century, a big change took place. Objects became the main subject of artworks. Artists got interested in arranging and studying a variety of natural, and human-made objects which remained still. The skill in painting it was in the manner that not only make it appear three-dimensional but as if life was added to them. This is why such artworks came to be called still life.

Still life are not restricted only to drawing and painting. Artists create still life compositions as photographs and sculptures too. Today, still life compositions are also used to create product advertisements for magazines, hoardings, newspapers, television, and so on.

| ACTIVITY 16.1: ARRANGING A STILL LIFE | 16.1: ARRANGING A STILL LIFE

Step 2: Choosing the backdrop

Select one or two large pieces of single-coloured cloth to create a backdrop. The colour ofthe cloth should not distract your attention from the objects, rather complements it. If you do not have cloth, you can use any other material that would create a plain backdrop so that the objects are in focus.


## A FEW OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS

In a still life, it is very important to have a visually interesting compositional arrangement. This leads our eye to explore every object as we perceive its contour, form, colour, texture and relate it to the other objects placed around it.

Make small groups according to your shared interests before beginning this activity.


## Step 1: Choosing objects for a still life

1. Choose objects from your everyday life and culture, which convey your identity and belonging. You would enjoy making it because you know its minutest details. For example, a basket, clock, ball, toy, shoes, trophies, flowers, fruits, etc.

2. Search for rare or unusual objects made by local artists along with other objects that complement it.

3. Select three to four objects that are of varying materials, colours, textures, sizes and dimensions.

CH-16_VA.indd 178 18-06-2025 16:07:07

Step 3: Arranging the objects

1. Drape the cloth with a few folds that fall naturally.

In each of these artworks, identify the side from

2. Place objects so that it appear to overlap a little when seen from different angles. The objects should be composed as one unit.

3. Experiment with interesting placements before finalising an arrangement. For example, an object can be placed upright or on its side, or leaning on something or raised, etc.

4. Light and shadow: Objects should be placed where light falls on it from one side, and creates tonalities and shadows. For this, you can partially close or open doors and windows in your classroom, or use screens, old banners, curtains or sheets to adjust, or filter the light.

The tradition of making hand-painted clay objects is seen across India. Some artists make fruits

Note to the Teacher: Let students select objects and experiment with different arrangements on the first day.

They can put away the arrangement till the next visual art period and rearrange the still life as decided.

A4 size paper or 1/4 chart paper, pencils, sharpeners, erasers, colouring medium of your choice

This activity will require 2 periods of 40 minutes each, preferably as a block-period.

The still life arrangement should not be disturbed while students are working.

In case students use markers or sketch pens, they can use cross-hatching and stippling techniques with different colours to achieve colour tonalities, light and shade.


## CH-16_VA.indd 180

In case students choose to prepare their own colours, ensure that the colours are ready to use before beginning this activity.

Ask students to participate in organising the seating arrangement in the classroom. They can sit around the still life arrangements in circular groups. By doing this, each student gets to view the object from a different angle.

18-06-2025 16:07:10


## Step 1: Observe the still life from your angle

Look at the examples below, made by 5 different students. Each student would have viewed this still life from a different angle.

Find their differences and analyse by observing these points—

1. The areas occupied by the blue and green backdrops.

2. The overlapping portions and spaces between the objects.

3. The shadows and highlights on the objects. 4. The mouths of both containers.


## Step 2: Five minutes observation

Look at the still life you have arranged and decide whether your drawing would fit better vertically, or horizontally. Use the maximum space on your paper for drawing.

Next, observe the following —

The size of each object and its proportion to the others.

» The lines and contours of every object.

Various shapes that are combined to make each object.


## 181 | STILL LIFE INCOLOUR


## CH-16_VA.indd 182


## “> Symmetries and asymmetries.

» Overlapping parts of the object (the portions that are not seen from your angle).

» Distance between objects and the shapes of its negative spaces.

“> Angle of light and the shadows (falling on the objects, cloth and surfaces).

Step 3: Draw the contour using light lines

» Mark the points of various objects that would be close to the edges of your paper. This will ensure that all your objects stay within the frame.

» Mark the ratio and proportion of objects. Use your pencil to measure the proportion of the smallest object in relation to the tallest object.

Important: Note the ratios for achieving correct proportions and not drawing the actual size of the objects.

» Draw the hidden basic shapes of each object and fit it within the markings you have made.

» Complete the contour and add details using light lines.


## 182 | KRITI


## TECHNICAL TIP

Keep lifting your head up every few seconds to observe the still life. This will improve your observation and help you achieve a close resemblance to the objects in your drawing.

18-06-2025 16:07:12

Step 4: Colour the still life

Use a medium of your choice, and try different techniques to show tones and shades of colours. Be

innovative while mixing colours and experiments with varying sizes, and colours of dots, lines, strokes and patches.

## INTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE

Paintings and drawings have the power to transport you to other worlds. Some appear two-dimensional and entice you with the beauty of lines, patterns, colours and textures. Some others appear three-dimensional as though they are popping out of the surface. Have you wondered how this happens?

Perspective is the technique of showing three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. It creates an illusion of distance and depth, where things that are closer, appear bigger and have more details than those that are further away. You can create this magic with practice, by keenly observing the views in front of you.

## GRD HUMAN ANATOMY

The structure of the human body is called anatomy. Look at your old photographs and notice how your body structure has changed from the time you were a baby till the present. Over the years, some parts of your body grow more than the others.

The relationship between the different parts of the body is measured, and expressed in ratio and proportions. For example, if the head is one part, we can find out which parts of the body are of the same size (1:1), which parts are twice the size of the head (1:2) and which parts are thrice the size of the head (1:3).


## Basic Proportions 8 Head divisions


## 192 | KRITI

The system of measuring the ratio and proportions of the human body has been a central part of Indian painting, and the sculpture traditions. Texts from the Shilpa Shastra mention different ratios and: proportions for depicting divine beings, people of 1 royalty, warriors, children, animals and various | other mythological beings. The system is known as the Talamana Paddhati, where the unit of one tala is 3 equal to the length of an adult hand measured from: the bottom of the wrist to the tip of the middle finger.

Mark the proportions for all the people in the picture as shown in the example.

» Mark the size of the head using two horizontal lines.

» Measure the distance between the two lines and use the same to mark more horizontal lines along the length of the body.

» Count the number of times the head repeated in each human figure.

There are small variations in the body proportions of every person, which makes them look different from others. There are no stereotypical proportions that everyone can fit into.

Observe the body proportions of your own friends and peers, and make drawings from it. Take turns to pose in standing positions so that you can observe and draw the whole body.

Step 1: Start with the head and note the proportions. You have learnt to use your pencil as a measuring tool while drawing still life objects. In the same way, use your pencil to measure the size of the head and note the number of times it repeats in the body.

Step 2: Based on the proportions that you have measured, make rough markings so that your drawing of the entire body fits comfortably on your paper.

Step 3: Continue to measure and verify the proportions as you draw each part. Focus on capturing the proportions that you see.

Step 4: Complete your drawing and share it with your friends. Take feedback from your teacher on the parts of your drawing that look proportionate and where you can improve.

After you make one or two drawings of the standing figure, observe the body proportions in different postures and positions, such as sitting, bending, lying, squatting, and other positions. Request your friends or family members to pose for you as you draw them.

Show them your drawings and tell them the fascinating things you have learnt about the proportions of human body.

## | ACTIVITY 17.4: COMPOSITION IN PERSPECTIVE | 17.4: COMPOSITION IN PERSPECTIVE

Now that you have learnt about perspective and human proportions, it’s time to create your own compositions that show people in indoor or outdoor settings.

Step 1: Make a few preparatory sketches for the layout of your composition

» Use your earlier drawings to plan the foreground, middleground and background elements. i Mark the horizon line and it vanishing point.

“> To begin, use three human figures shown in varying distances—one can be near and another in a distance.

» Using your knowledge of proportion and perspective, draw the other elements, such as furniture, objects, trees, roads, vehicles, buildings, etc.

Note: The human figures should be proportionate to the landscape or indoor setting they are placed in.

Step 2: Choose one layout

Show your preparatory sketches to your teacher, take their suggestions and discuss your choice for your final artwork.

Step 3: Begin the final artwork

Line drawing—Using the reference of your preparatory sketches, start drawing.

» Edits and changes— Make small changes or additions to your compositions while you draw.


## Step 4: Colouring process

» Choose any medium to colour your artwork (colour pencils, pastels, crayons, watercolours, poster colours, acrylic colours, natural colours, etc.).

“» Choose your colour theme based on seasons, time of the day, mood and so on.


## “> Try different combinations on your preparatory sketches.

“> Now, you are ready to execute your final artwork.

Step 5: Title your artwork

“* Jot down a few thoughts about your artwork (your ideas, inspirations, memories and personal connections).

» Based on these thoughts, write

a short phrase that could be the title of your artwork.

Note: The teacher can display everyone’s work and have a class.

Art is a part of our everyday life. From the clothes we wear to the plate we eat from, all is a piece of art. In this chapter, you will be introduced to a variety of art practices that primarily use everyday materials like thread, paper and cloth to create beautiful objects, and artwork. You will learn how these materials are crafted using specific techniques, and in the process, you will be able to appreciate the hard work, patience and dedication of hundreds of artists, who have kept these traditions alive.

## Work in small groups for this activity.

Step 1: Collect old fabric from your homes that are not in use anymore. Go around and check in your school as well.

Step 2: Find a large piece that is minimum 30 cm x 30 cm to use as your base.

Step 3: Gather the other pieces you have collected and cut them into squares or rectangles of approximately 5-6 cm.

Step 4: Spread your base fabric and place the smaller pieces over it in a pattern you find visually interesting.

Step 5: Join and sew the individual pieces together along their edges on the reverse side. This will ensure that the stitches are not seen when you flip them over.

Step 6: After joining all the small pieces, place the patchwork on the base cloth and sew it using many lines of running stitches over the patches. You can create interesting patterns and use coloured threads for the lines of running stitches.

Step 7: Complete your quilt by closing up the edges with another piece of cloth or by folding and stitching.

Note on safety: Take precautions while using sharp objects like the scissors and needles. Use a sponge or a dedicated piece of thick cloth to store your needles so that they do not get misplaced and cause harm to others.

Some quilting artists create elaborate pictures and visual stories using this technique.


## | ACTIVITY 18.3: PULP AND PAINT | 18.3: PULP AND PAINT

Thousands of newspapers are printed daily. They are discarded after reading and are sometimes reused as packaging material, or made into bags, and so on.

What do you do with old newspapers?

When certain kinds of soft paper like newspaper and tissue are mixed with water and glue, they become very strong.

Papier-maché is a_ technique through which this mixture of paper, water and glue are molded into a three-dimensional form.

These forms are inspired by the artist’s environment and their culture. They are then painted using pigments available in the region. Even though artists use the same

Step 1: Cut old newspapers into small pieces or thin strips and soak them in water for a few days in a large tub or container.

Step 2: Take out the soaked paper and squeeze out the excess water from it.

Step 3: Crush, mash or grind the paper into a pulp. You can also use a mortar and pestle to grind it by hand.

Step 4: Add a little glue to the paper pulp and mix it well.

Step 5: Take a small bowl or any other shallow object as your mould and coat its outer surface with any greasy substance like petroleum jelly or a thick oil.

Step 6: Turn the object upside down. Take thin strips of damp newspaper and overlap them over the object evenly till the entire surface is covered. Apply the pulp thickly and evenly over the entire object. Allow it to dry completely for a few days.

Step 7: When dry, turn the object over and gently release the mould.

Step 8: Neaten up your papier-maché artwork by using a fine sandpaper, and add colour and decorations to it.

For your campaign, begin by choosing a subject. You can work with an artist who may be a painter, sculptor, designer or photographer. You can also choose a community that is keeping an art and craft tradition alive, like you studied in the previous chapter or a school production, or even a project of your own.

Make small groups of 4 to 5 students each and think about a subject for your campaign together. Here are some prompts —

Do you know any artists and art practices from your region? Is there an upcoming festival, local crafts fair

in your locality where you are likely to meet artists?


## Are there any art and design schools in your region?

Is there an art museum or gallery near you? What kind of artworks do they exhibit?
